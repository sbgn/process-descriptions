To quickly describe what SBGN \PDl is about, we let's give a brief overview of some of the relevant concepts with the help of an example shown in \fig{eg1}.

  \caption{This example of a \PD uses two kinds of entity pool nodes: one for pools of different macromolecules (\sect{macromolecule}) and
    another for pools of simple chemicals (\sect{simpleChemical}). Most macromolecule nodes in this map are adorned with state
    variables (\sect{stateVariable}) representing phosphorylation states. This map uses one type of process node, the process node
    (\sect{process}), and three kind of connecting arc, consumption (\sect{consumption}), production (\sect{production}) and catalysis
    (\sect{catalysis}).  Finally, some entity pool nodes have dark bands along their bottoms; these are clone markers (\sect{cloneMarker}) indicating that the same pool nodes appear multiple times in the map.}

The map in \fig{eg1} is a simple map for part of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade.  The larger nodes in the figure (some of which are in the shape of rounded rectangles and others in the shape of circles) represent biological materials---things like macromolecules and simple chemicals.  The biological materials are altered via processes, which are indicated in \PDl by lines with arrows and other decorations.  In this particular map, all of the processes happen to be the same: processes catalyzed by biochemical entities.  The directions of the arrows indicate the direction of the processes; for example, unphosphorylated RAF kinase processes to phosphorylated RAF kinase via a process catalyzed by RAS. Although ATP and ADP are shown as incidental to the phosphorylations on this particular graph, they are involved in the same process as the proteins getting phosphorylated. The small circles on the nodes for RAF and other entity pools represent state variables (in this case, phosphorylation sites). 

The essence of the \PDs is \emph{change}: it shows how different entities in the system process from one form to another.  The entities themselves can be many different things.  In the example of \fig{eg1}, they are either pools of macromolecules or pools of simple chemicals, but as will become clear later in this chapter, they can be other conceptual and material constructs as well.  Note also that we speak of \emph{entity pools} rather than individuals; this is because in biochemical network models, one does not focus on single molecules, but rather collections of molecules of the same kind.  The molecules in a given pool are considered indistinguishable from each other.  The way in which one type of entity is transformed into another is conveyed by a \emph{process node} and arcs between entity pool nodes and process nodes indicate an influence by the entities on the processes.  In the case of \fig{eg1}, those arcs describe consumption \sect{consumption}, production \sect{production} and catalysis \sect{catalysis}, but others are possible.  Finally, nodes in \PDs are usually not repeated; if they do need to be repeated, they are marked with \emph{clone markers}---specific modifications to the appearance of the node (\sect{cloneMarker}). The details of this and other aspects of \PD notation are explained in the rest of this chapter.
