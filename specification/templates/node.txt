    %ELSEIF OPERATOR%
        The incoming \glyph{logic arcs} (\sect{logicArc}) are linked to the extremity of the leftmost or uppermost port, while the outgoing \glyph{logic arc} (\sect{logicArc}) or \glyph{modulation} (\sect{modulation}) is linked to the extremity of the rightmost or bottommost port.
