\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Necessary stimulation}}
\label{sec:necessary_stim}

A necessary stimulation is one that is necessary for a process to take place. A process modulated by a necessary stimulation can only occur when this necessary stimulation is active.

\begin{glyphDescription}

\glyphSboTerm
SBO:0000171 ! necessary stimulation

\glyphOrigin
One \glyph{EPN} (\sect{EPNs}) or \glyph{logical operator} (\sect{logic}).

\glyphTarget
One \glyph{process node} (\sect{PNs}).

\glyphSymbol
The target extremity of a \glyph{necessary stimulation} carries an open arrowhead (to remind that it is a \glyph{stimulation}) coming after a larger perpendicular bar, as shown in \fig{Necessary Stimulation}.

\end{glyphDescription}

The example in \fig{necessary_stim-gene} below describes the transcription of a gene~X, that is the creation of a messenger RNA~X triggered by the gene~X.  The creation of the protein~X is then triggered by the mRNA~X.  (Note that the same example could be represented using the gene as reactant and product, although it is semantically different.)

The example in \fig{necessary_stim-calcium} below describes the transport of calcium ions out of the endoplasmic reticulum. Without IP3 receptor, there is no calcium flux, therefore, one cannot use a \glyph{stimulation}.
The \glyph{necessary stimulation} instead represents the necessity for the receptor to be present for the transport to take place.

  \caption{The transport of calcium ions out of the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. Note that IP3R crosses both compartment boundaries. This is allowed, but the Macromolecule should only belong to one of the compartments see section \ref{sec: unresolved multi-comp ents} for more discussion of this issue.}
