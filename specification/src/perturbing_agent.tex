\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Perturbing agent}}
\label{sec:perturbing agent}

Biochemical networks can be affected by external influences.
Those influences can be the effect of well-defined physical perturbing agents, such as a light pulse or a change in temperature; they can also be more complex and not well-defined phenomena, for instance the outcome of a biological process, an experimental setup, or a mutation.
For these situations, \PD provides the \glyph{perturbing agent} glyph. It is an EPN, and represents the amount of perturbing agent applied to a process.

\begin{glyphDescription}

\glyphSboTerm
SBO:0000405 ! perturbing agent


\glyphIncoming
None.

\glyphOutgoing
One or more \glyph{modulation arcs} (\sect{modulations}) or \glyph{logic arcs} (\sect{logicArc}), zero or more \glyph{equivalence arcs} (\sect{equivalenceArc}).

\glyphContainer
A \glyph{perturbing agent} is represented by a by a modified hexagonal shape having two opposite concave faces, as shown in \fig{perturbing_agent}.

\glyphLabel
A \glyph{perturbing agent} is identified by a label that is  a string of characters that may be distributed on several lines to improve readability.
The centre of the label must be placed on the centre of the container.
The label may extend outside of the container.

\glyphAux
A \glyph{perturbing agent} can carry one or more \glyph{units of information} (\sect{unitInfo}).
Particular \glyph{units of information} are available for describing the material type (\sect{material-types-cv}) and the conceptual type (\sect{conceptual-types-cv}) of a \glyph{perturbing agent}, as well as its physical characteristic (see \sect{physical-characteristics-cv}).

A \glyph{perturbing agent} can also carry a \glyph{simple clone marker} (see \sect{cloneMarker}).
