\section{Financial Support}

The development of SBGN was mainly supported by a grant from the Japanese \emph{New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization} (NEDO, \url{http://www.nedo.go.jp/}).  The \emph{Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology} (OIST, \url{http://www.oist.jp/}), the \emph{AIST Computational Biology Research Center} (AIST CBRC, \url{http://www.cbrc.jp/index.eng.html}) the British \emph{Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council} (BBSRC, \url{http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/}) through a Japan Partnering Award, the European Media Laboratory (EML Research gGmbH, \url{http://www.eml-r.org/}), and the Beckman Institute at the California Institute of Technology (\url{http://bnmc.caltech.edu}) provided additional support for SBGN workshops. Some help was supplied by the \emph{Japan Science and Technology Agency} (JST, \url{http://www.jst.go.jp/}) and the \emph{Genome Network Project} of the Japanese Ministry of Education, Sports, Culture, Science, and Technology (MEXT, \url{http://www.mext.go.jp/}) for the development of the gene regulation network aspect of SBGN, and from the \emph{Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council} (EPSRC, \url{http://www.epsrc.ac.uk}) during the redaction of the specification. The \emph{German Ministry of Education and Research} (\url{https://www.bmbf.de/}) provided support for an SBGN workshop and the redaction of the specification. Funding from \emph{National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)} grant (P41 GM103504) and \emph{National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)} grant (U41 HG006623) was additionally used for the redaction of the specification.
