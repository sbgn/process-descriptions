\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Tag}}
\label{sec:tag}

A \glyph{tag} is a named handle, or reference, to another \glyph{EPN} (\sect{EPNs}) or \glyph{compartment} (\sect{compartment}) of the map.
Together with the \glyph{submap terminal} (\sect{submapTerminal}), it allows linking glyphs of a map to their counterpart in a submap.
