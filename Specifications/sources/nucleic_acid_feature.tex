\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Nucleic acid feature}}
\label{sec:genetic}

The \emph{nucleic acid feature} represents a fragment of a macromolecule carrying genetic information.
A common use for this construct is to represent a gene or transcript.
The label of this EPN and its \emph{units of information} are often crucial for making the purpose clear to the reader of a map.

\begin{glyphDescription}

\glyphSboTerm
SBO:0000354 ! informational molecule segment

\add{
\glyphIncoming
Zero or more \glyph{production} arcs (\sect{production}).
}

\add{
\glyphOutgoing
Zero or more \glyph{consumption} arcs (\sect{consumption}), \glyph{modulation arcs} (\sect{modulations}), \glyph{logic arcs} (\sect{logicArc}), or \glyph{equivalence arcs} (\sect{equivalenceArc}).
}

\glyphContainer
A \glyph{nucleic acid feature} is represented by a rectangular shape whose bottom half has rounded corners.
This design reminds us that we are fundamentally dealing with a unit of information\corr{, but this information}{ carried by a macromolecule}.\dogrusoz{looks like something was lost here?\\
AR: ?}

\glyphLabel
A \glyph{nucleic acid feature} is identified by a label that is \corr{an unbordered box containing}{} a string of characters \corr{.
The characters}{that} may be distributed on several lines to improve readability.
The centre of the label must be placed on the centre of the \corr{shape}{container}.
The label may extend outside of the \corr{shape}{container}.

\glyphAux
A \glyph{nucleic acid feature} can carry one or more \glyph{state variables} that add information about its state (\sect{stateVariable}).
The state of a \glyph{nucleic acid feature} is defined as the set of all its \glyph{state variables}.

A \glyph{nucleic acid feature} can also carry one or more \glyph{units of information} (\sect{unitInfo}).
These can characterise a domain, such as a binding site.
Particular \glyph{units of information} are available for describing the material type (\sect{material-types-cv}) and the conceptual type (\sect{conceptual-types-cv}) of a \glyph{nucleic acid feature}.

Finally, a \glyph{nucleic acid feature} can also carry a \glyph{labelled clone marker} (see \sect{cloneMarker}).
