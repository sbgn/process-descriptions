\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Production}}
\label{sec:production}

\glyph{Production} is the arc used to represent the fact that an entity pool is produced by a process. In the case of a reversible process, the \glyph{production} arc represents both a consumption and a production.

\begin{glyphDescription}

\glyphSboTerm
SBO:0000393 ! production

\glyphOrigin
One \glyph{process node} (\sect{PNs}).

\glyphTarget
One \glyph{EPN} (\sect{EPNs}).

\glyphSymbol
The target extremity of a \glyph{production} carries a filled arrowhead, as shown in \fig{production}.

\end{glyphDescription}

A cardinality label may be associated with a \glyph{production} arc, indicating the stoichiometry of a process.

\fig{prod-card} illustrates the use of \glyph{consumption}/\glyph{production} arc cardinality labels to represent the stoichiometry of a process.

  The process on the top is wrong as the stoichiometry is not represented, which leads to ambiguity.}
