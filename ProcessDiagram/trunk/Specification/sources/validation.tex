% This section describes criteria that must be met by the diagram (or SBGN-ML diagram description) to conform
% \SBGNPDLone specification. 

% This is still to be completed. However, the plan is to extract the
% rules itemised throughput the specification and duplicate them
% here. Extraction will be carried out using a script so although the
% information will be redundant it will be easy to keep this section
% consistent with the rest of the specification.

% All criteria has unique and perennial numbering. In the case when modification of the specification makes a rule
% irrelevant it will be deleted but the number of the rule will not be taken, so there will be gaps in rule numbering.
