First we specifically acknowledge those who contributed directly to each revision of the  specification document, followed by a comprehensive acknowledgement of contributors that attended workshops and forum meetings or in some other way provided input to the standard. Finally, we acknowledge the bodies that provided financial support for the development of the standard.

\section{Financial Support}

The development of SBGN was mainly supported by a grant from the Japanese \emph{New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization} (NEDO, \url{http://www.nedo.go.jp/}).  The \emph{Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology} (OIST, \url{http://www.oist.jp/}), the \emph{AIST Computational Biology Research Center} (AIST CBRC, \url{http://www.cbrc.jp/index.eng.html}) the British \emph{Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council} (BBSRC, \url{http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/}) through a Japan Partnering Award, the European Media Laboratory (EML Research gGmbH, \url{http://www.eml-r.org/}), and the Beckman Institute at the California Institute of Technology (\url{http://bnmc.caltech.edu}) provided additional support for SBGN workshops.  Some help was provided by the \emph{Japan Science and Technology Agency} (JST, \url{http://www.jst.go.jp/}) and the \emph{Genome Network Project} of the Japanese Ministry of Education, Sports, Culture, Science, and Technology (MEXT, \url{http://www.mext.go.jp/}) for the development of the gene regulation network aspect of SBGN, and from the \emph{Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council} (EPSRC, \url{http://www.epsrc.ac.uk}) during the redaction of the specification.
