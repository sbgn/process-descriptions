\chapter{Concepts and Glyphs}
\label{chp:glyphs}


\section{Introduction}

Although ultimately defined by its glyphs, \SBGNPDLone these glyphs
represent concepts that are related to varying degrees and ultimately
can be organised hierarchically. This provides us with a useful way or
organising the glyphs and thinking about \PD{}.  Therefore in this
chapter we describe the conceptual structure of \SBGNPDLone and place
each glyph within this structure. For each glyph or concept we describe its
physical appearance and define syntax and other usage rules. An
overview of this hierarchy is provided in figures
\ref{fig:sbgn_node_tax} and \ref{fig:sbgn_edge_tax}.

\subsection{Entity pool}\label{sec:EPNs}

An entity pool is a population of entities that cannot be distinguished from each other, when it comes to the \SBGNPDLone map. For instance all the molecular  entities that fulfill the same role in a given process form an entity pool. As a result, an entity pool can represent different granularity levels, such as all the proteins, all the instances of a given protein, only certain forms of a given protein. To belong to a different compartment is sufficient to belong to different entity pools. Calcium ions in the endoplasmic reticulum and calcium ions in the cytosol belong to different entity pools when it comes to representing calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum.

The \PD contains six glyphs representing classes of material entities:
\glyph{unspecified entity} (\sect{unspecifiedEntity}), \glyph{simple
  chemical} (\sect{simpleChemical}), \glyph{macromolecule}
(\sect{macromolecule}), \glyph{nucleic acid feature} (\sect{genetic}),
\glyph{multimer} (\sect{multimer}) and \glyph{complex}
(\sect{complex}).  (Specific types of macromolecules, such as protein,
RNA, DNA, polysaccharide, and specific simple chemicals are not
defined by \PD but may be part of future levels of SBGN.)  In addition
to the material entities, \PD represents three conceptual entities:
\glyph{empty set} (\sect{sourceSink}), and \glyph{perturbing agent}
(\sect{perturbing agent}).
 
\subsubsection{Stateless Entity Pool}

This is a pool where the entities do not change `state'. In otherwords
the entities do not undergo any physical change that is useful to
record in a \PD diagram. Therefore these glyphs cannot be assigned a state-variable.

\input{sources/simpleChemical.tex}
\input{sources/unspecified.tex}
\input{sources/sourceSink.tex}
\input{sources/perturbing_agent.tex}

\subsubsection{Stateful Entity Pool}

Stateful entity pools can undergo physical changes, for example chemical
modifcation or conformational change, which we wish to record in a \PD
diagram. They can be assigned one or more state-variables.

\subsection{Process}\label{sec:PNs}

Process nodes represent processes that transform one or several entity
pools into one or several entity pools, identical or different. Note
that a process may be used to represent or summarise more than one
known process.  \SBGNPDLone defines a generic \glyph{process}
(\sect{process}), as well as five more specific ones: the
\glyph{omitted process} (\sect{omitted}), the \glyph{uncertain
  process} (\sect{uncertain}), the \glyph{association}
(\sect{association}), the \glyph{dissociation} (\sect{dissociation}),
and the \glyph{phenotype} (\sect{phenotype}).

\subsubsection{Non-stoichiometric process}

 Process that does not necessarily result in measurable change of entity pools, and which does necessarily have a defined start and end point.

\subsection{Container}

\subsubsection{Canvas}

An \PD diagram has a canvas upon which an SBGN diagram is drawn. It is
not a glyph in the sense that there is no shape drawn to represent it,
but \SBGNPDLone has rules about what can be drawn directly on the canvas so
it is useful to describe it here.

\begin{glyphDescription}
\item[Identifying Attributes:]\mbox{}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item identity
 \end{itemize}
\item[Special constraints or rules:]\mbox{}\newline If one
  \glyph{Compartment} is drawn on the canvas then all EPNs must be
  drawn in a \glyph{Compartment} and cannot be drawn directly onto the
  Canvas\footnote{All EPNs must beling to a compartment. When no compartment is drawn then all EPNs can be
    thought of as belonging to an imaginary ``default''
    compartment. But when one or more EPNs are assigned to an explicit
  compartment then for clarity all compartments must be explicity
  drawn and EPNs assigned to them.}.

\glyphSboTerm Not assigned

\glyphContainer None

\glyphLabel None

\glyphAux The Canvas can have \glyph{Container} glyphs and any EPN,
Process and Arcs as children. However all Auxiliary glyphs cannot be
children of the Canvas.
 
\glyphCloning N/A

\end{glyphDescription}

\input{sources/compartment.tex}

\subsection{Auxiliary units}

Auxiliary units are glyphs that decorate other glyphs, providing additional information that may be useful to the reader. These can provide annotation (\glyph{unit of information}), state information (\glyph{state variable}) or indicate duplication of entity pool nodes (\glyph{clone marker}).

\input{sources/unitInformation.tex}
\input{sources/stateVariable.tex}
\input{sources/annotation.tex}

\subsection{Reference nodes}

Reference nodes handle links or relationships between elements of a
map and sub-map. At present there is only one reference glyph,
\glyph{tag}, which can be used in a map refered to by a \glyph{submap}
(\sect{submap}) or as an auxilary unit on the \glyph{submap}. The
\glyph{clone marker} can also provide additional reference mechanisms
and is discussed below (\sect{cloneMarker}).

\input{sources/tag.tex}

\subsection{Arcs}\label{sec:arcs}

Arcs are lines that link \glyph{EPNs} and \glyph{PNs} together.  The symbols attached to their extremities indicate their semantics.
