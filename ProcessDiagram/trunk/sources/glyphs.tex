\chapter{Concepts and Glyphs}
\label{chp:glyphs}


\section{Introduction}

Although ultimately defined by its glyphs, \SBGNPDLone these glyphs
represent concepts that are related to varying degrees and ultimately
can be organised hierarchically. This provides us with a useful way or
organising the glyphs and thinking about \PD{}.  Therefore in this
chapter we describe the conceptual structure of \SBGNPDLone and place
each glyph within this structure. For each glyph or concept we describe its
physical appearance and define syntax and other usage rules. An
overview of this hierarchy is provided in figure
\ref{fig:sbgn_node_tax}.

\section{How to read the Language Specification}

\begin{itemize}
\item Organised alphabetically.
\item use UML to describe the language elements.
\item Some language elements decribe concepts and rules, some
  describe elements that are represented by glyphs, other both.
\item Class represent concepts.
\item Classes have attributes which are required (R), optional (O), or can be
  a collection of a number of values. In the latter case the permitted
  of range is specified as:
  \begin{description}
  \item[*] any number
  \item[1..*] 1 or more
  \end{description}
\item Associations are indicated by solid lines. If there is a black
  diamont then this means the class the diamond is closest to contains
  the other class. This means the contained class cannot exist without
  the parent class, \ie if the containing class instance is destroyed
  then the contained is too.
\item open diamonds are a referencing association, the referenced
  class can exist without the refernecing class.
\item dependency indicates that there is an indirect association
  between these classes.
\item direction containment or referencing means that one side see the
  other, but the other does not see the refernecing class.
\item cardinality on the edges of the class refer to the distrant
  class and indicate the follwoing:
  \begin{description}
  \item[1] mandatory that one instance is associated.
  \item[*] optional - any number of instances permited in association
  \item[1..*] mandatroy that at least 1 is associated
  \item[0..1] Optional. instance is optional.
  \end{description}
  \item class defines all possible cases
  \item instance is a single case of the class with attributes and
    associates set. In SBGN case a glyph is an instance of a class.
  \item Idea is that UML defines language elements and then the
    notation sections specifies the graphical
    representation. Equivalent to the grammar of a language and the
    letters used to write it.
  \item aim is to minimise duplication of rules as much as possible to
    improve maintainability. Compromised between that and readability
    and ease of understanding spec.
\end{itemize}

\section{Definitions}
\label{sec:definitions}

\subsection{SBGNElement}
\label{defn:SBGNElement}

All the glyphs in \SBGNPDLone inherit from
\sbgnclass{SBGNElement}. This is an abstract or conceptual class that
helps organise \PD conceptually. \sbgnclass{SBGNElement} (figure
\ref{fig:mapuml}) has a single attribute \attrib{id} that is an
identifying attribute. This means that all SBGN elements defined here,
which ultimately extend \sbgnclass{SBGNBase}, can all be uniquely
identified from each other. This makes sense if you think that a glyph
drawn on a map is distinct from another glyph drawn on the map. The
\attrib{id} attribute reflects this and is not shown explicitly in a
\PDm.


\subsubsection{Generalisation}

None

\subsubsection{Attributes}

\begin{attributes}
  \attitem{id}{identifier}{R} uniquely identified all SBGN elements in
  the same namespace.
\end{attributes}

\subsubsection{Changes from Previous Version}

Not defined in the previous version.

\subsection{Map}
\label{defn:Map}\label{sec:map}


\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/mapuml}
  \caption{UML definition of Map and \sbgnclass{SBGNElement}.}
  \label{fig:mapuml}
\end{figure}

The \sbgnclass{Map} (figure \ref{fig:mapuml}) is a container that
holds all the glyphs drawn in a \PDm. A \sbgnclass{Map} may contain a
\classref{SubmapNode} in which case some of the detail is summarised
in another \PDm. In this case the former is referred to as the ``Main
Map'' and the latter the ``Submap''. A Main Map shares the same
namespace as its Submap and uses the \classref{CrossReference}
identify the interface between both maps. The details of Main Map and
Submap linking semantics are described in more detail in section
\ref{sec:submaplinkingsemantics}.


\subsubsection{Generalisation}

\begin{itemize}
\item \classref{SBGNElement}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Attributes}

No additional attributes

\subsubsection{Associations}

\begin{attributes}
\associtem{elements}{SBGNGlyph}{*} The collection of glyphs held by the map. 
\end{attributes}

\subsubsection{Rules and Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
\item A map is valid if it is empty (although not very useful).
\item All instances of \classref{SBGNGlyph} must be unique (see
  section \ref{sec:uniquenessdefinition}).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Notation}

The map is the canvas upon which the \PDl is drawn. It's only visible
feature is its colour. It can take any pattern or colour (or be
transparent for that matter), but as SBGN is `colour blind' this does
not convey any meaning in itself.

\subsubsection{Changes from Previous Version}

Not defined explicitly in previous versions.

 The \sbgnclass{AuxiliaryUnit} (figure \ref{fig:auxiliaryunituml}) represents symbols that may be used to
adorn glyphs. In doing so they change the meaning of the glyph and/or provide
additional information about it.

\subsection{SBGNNode}
\label{defn:SBGNNode}

The \sbgnclass{SBGNNode} (figure \ref{fig:glyphauxuml}) represents the nodes in the graph structure
that is the core representation within \PDl. The nodes are connected
to glyphs descended from \sbgnclass{SBGNArc} for form a direct graph.

\subsection{SBGNArc}
\label{defn:SBGNArc}

The \sbgnclass{SBGNArc} (figure \ref{fig:glyphauxuml}) represents the arcs (also know as edges) in
the graph structure that is the core representation within \PDl. The
arc is connected to two nodes descended from \sbgnclass{SBGNNode}, one
at each end. As the arc has a direction (directed arc) these nodes are
by convention designated the \emph{out node} to indicate the arc is
leaving the node and \emph{in node} to indicate that it is entering
the node.

\subsection{EntityPoolNode}
\label{sec:EPNs}\label{defn:EntityPoolNode}\label{sec:EPN}

An entity pool is a population of entities that cannot be
distinguished from each other, when it comes to the \SBGNPDLone
map. For instance all the molecular entities that fulfill the same
role in a given process form an entity pool. As a result, an entity
pool can represent different granularity levels, such as all the
proteins, all the instances of a given protein, only certain forms of
a given protein. To belong to a different compartment is sufficient to
belong to different entity pools. Calcium ions in the endoplasmic
reticulum and calcium ions in the cytosol belong to different entity
pools when it comes to representing calcium release from the
endoplasmic reticulum.

% The \PD contains five glyph types representing classes of material
% entities: \glyph{unspecified entity} (\sect{unspecifiedEntity}),
% \glyph{simple chemical} (\sect{simpleChemical}), \glyph{macromolecule}
% (\sect{macromolecule}), \glyph{nucleic acid feature} (\sect{genetic})
% and \glyph{complex} (\sect{complex}).  (Specific types of
% macromolecules, such as protein, RNA, DNA, polysaccharide, and
% specific simple chemicals are not defined by \PD but may be part of
% future levels of SBGN.)  In addition to the material entities, \PD
% represents a conceptual entities: \glyph{perturbing agent} (\sect{perturbing
%   agent}).

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{images/epnuml}
\caption{UML definition of the entity pool node and its descendant glyphs.}
  \label{fig:epnuml}
\end{figure}
 
The \sbgnclass{EntityPoolNode} (figure \ref{fig:epnuml}) is the common
ancestor of all these glyphs and defines attributes that are common to
all its descendants. It must belong to a compartment (c.f.\, section
\ref{sec:compartment})  and can contain a clone marker if it is
cloned. Note that not all EPNs can be cloned.

\subsubsection{Generalisation}

\begin{itemize}
\item \classref{SBGNNode}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Attributes}

\begin{attributes}
  \attitem{label}{string}{R} The name that identifies the entity in the
  \PDm. EPNs with the same label should be from the same entity. the
  string cannot be empty and must start and end with a non-space
  character. Any Unicode character is acceptable.
  \attitem{cardinality}{int}{R} The number of copies of the entity. Must
  be a positive non-zero integer.
  \attitem{natures}{cv}{O} The nature of the entity pool node as defined
  by a controlled vocabulary. Zero, one or more values may be set, but
  each one must belong to a different controlled vocabulary.
\end{attributes}

\subsubsection{Associations}

\begin{attributes}
 \associtem{owning\_compartment}{Compartment}{0..1} The compartment
  that this EPN belongs too.
  \associtem{clone\_marker}{CloneMarker}{0..1} The clone marker
  decorator. See section \ref{sec:cloneMarker} for its use.
 \associtem{displayed\_attributes}{AttributeValue}{*} One or
 more decorators used to display attribute values.
\end{attributes}

\subsubsection{Logical Identity}

\begin{logicalkey}
\item \attrib{owning\_compartment}
\item \attrib{name}
\item \attrib{cardinality}
\item \attrib{natures}
\end{logicalkey}

\subsubsection{Rules and Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
\item If \attrib{cardinality} $>1$ then the descendant glyph must be displayed
  as a multimer.
\item If the EPN is drawn directly on a \glyph{Map} then
 \attrib{owning\_compartment} is assigned to an invisible default
 compartment.
 \attrib{nature} can only use the material type (section
 \ref{sec:material-types-cv}), conceptual type (section \ref{sec:conceptual-types-cv}) or physical
 characteristics (section \ref{sec:physical-characteristics-cv}) controlled vocabularies.
\item The appropriate subclass of \sbgnclass{CloneMarker} must be used
  to distinguish logically identical instances of this class.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Notation}

Although there is no direct graphical representation of this class
this class does affect the appearance of the
\sbgnclass{AttributeValue} and its associated glyph the \glyph{Unit of
  Information}. The \glyph{Unit of Information} can be used to present
the \attrib{cardinality} and \attrib{natures} attributes. These used
the following codes to indicate which attribute is being presented''

\begin{center}
  \begin{itemize}\setlength{\parskip}{0ex}
  \item[\texttt{pc}] container physical characteristic
  \item[\texttt{mt}] entity pool material type
  \item[\texttt{ct}] entity pool conceptual type
  \item[\texttt{N}]  multimer cardinality
  \end{itemize}
\end{center}

\subsection{Empty Set}
\label{sec:sourceSink}

It is useful to have the ability to represent the creation of an entity or
a state from an unspecified source, that is, from something that one does
not need or wish to make precise.  For instance, in a model where the
production of a protein is represented, it may not be desirable to
represent all of the amino acids, sugars and other metabolites used, or the
energy involved in the protein's creation.  Similarly, we may not wish to
bother representing the details of the destruction or decomposition of some
biochemical species into a large number of more primitive entities,
preferring instead to simply say that the species ``disappears into a
sink''.  Yet another example is that one may need to represent an input
(respectively, output) into (resp. from) a compartment without explicitly
representing a transport process from a source (resp. to a target).

For these and other situations, SBGN defines a single glyph to handle
these situations representing the involvement of an external pool of entities.  The symbol
used in SBGN is borrowed from the mathematical symbol for ``empty set'',
but it is important to note that it does not actually represent a true
absence of everything or a physical void---it represents the absence of the
corresponding structures in the model, that is, the fact that the
external pool is conceptually outside the scope of the map.

A frequently asked question is, why bother having an explicit symbol at
all?  The reason is that one cannot simply use an arc that does not
terminate on a node, because the dangling end could be mistaken to be
pointing to another node in the map.  This is specially true if the
map is rescaled, causing the spacing of elements in the map to
change.  The availability and use of an explicit symbol for sources and
sinks is critical.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/emptysetuml}
  \caption{The UML definition of the \glyph{EmptySet} and its context
    in relation to other elements of the \PDl.}
  \label{fig:emptysetuml}
\end{figure}

The definition of the \glyph{Empty Set} is shown in figure
\ref{fig:emptysetuml}. The empty set is not an EPN as it does not
represent a single pool of entities and does not share any of the
other attributes of an EPN, nor does it belong to a particular
compartment.

\fig{sourceSink} illustrates this.  The symbol should be linked to one
and only one edge in a map.
\glyphLabel None
\end{glyphDescription}

\subsubsection{Changes from Previous Version}

The \sbgnclass{EmptySet} and \glyph{Empty Set} glyph has replaced the \glyph{Source} and
\glyph{Sink} glyphs. This symbols used remains the same, but the
underlying concept has changed. The \glyph{Source} and \glyph{Sink}
glyphs where types of EPN.

\subsection{StatelessEPN}
\label{defn:StatelessEPN}

The \sbgnclass{StatelessEPN} (figure \ref{fig:statelessepnuml})
represents a pool where the entities do not change `state'. In
other-words the entities do not undergo any physical change that is
useful to record in a \PDm. Therefore these glyphs cannot be assigned
a state-variable.

\subsection{Simple chemical}
\label{sec:simpleChemical}

A simple chemical in SBGN is defined as the opposite of a
macromolecule (\sect{macromolecule}): it is a chemical compound that
is \emph{not} formed by the covalent linking of pseudo-identical
residues.  Examples of simple chemicals are an atom, a monoatomic ion,
a salt, a radical, a solid metal, a crystal, etc. The complex can be
represented by a monomeric glyph (\glyph{Simple chemical monomer}) and
a multimeric glyph (\glyph{Simple chemical multimer}).

must remain a circle and cannot be deformed into an eclipse.
\glyphLabel The identification of the \glyph{simple chemical} is carried by an unbordered box containing a string of characters.  The characters may be distributed on several lines to improve readability, although this is not mandatory.  The label box has to be attached to the center of the circular container.  The label is permitted to spill outside the container.

\glyphContainer  A \glyph{simple chemical multimer} is represented by two identical containers shifted horizontally and vertically and stacked one on top of the other.  \fig{multimer} illustrates the glyph.
\glyphLabel A \glyph{multimer} has no identity on its own.  However, the first of the monomers carries an identifying label.  The label is placed in an unbordered box containing a string of characters.  The characters can be distributed on several lines to improve readability, although this is not mandatory.  The label box must be attached to the center of the top monomer's container.  The label may spill outside of the container.

\subsubsection{Changes from Previous Version}

The glyphs used for the \sbgnclass{SimpleChemical} have been

\subsection{UnspecifiedEntity}
\label{sec:unspecifiedEntity}

The simplest type of EPN is the \sbgnclass{UnspecifiedEntity}: one whose
type is unknown or simply not relevant to the purposes of the map.
This arises, for example, when the existence of the entity has been
inferred indirectly, or when the entity is merely a construct
introduced for the needs of a map, without direct biological
relevance.  These are examples of situations where the
\sbgnclass{UnspecifiedEntity} is appropriate.  (Conversely, for
cases where the identity of the entities composing the pool \emph{is}
known, there exist other, more specific glyphs described elsewhere in
the specification.)

\subsection{Perturbing Agent}
\label{sec:perturbing agent}

Biochemical networks can be affected by external influences.  Those
influences can be the effect of well-defined physical perturbing
agents, such as a light pulse or a change in temperature; they can
also be more complex and not well-defined phenomena, for instance the
outcome of a biological process, an experimental setup, or a mutation.
For these situations, SBGN provides the \glyph{perturbing agent}
glyph. It is an EPN, and represents the amount to perturbing agent
applied to a process.

\subsection{StatefulEPN}
\label{defn:StatefulEPN}

Stateful entity pools can undergo physical changes, for example
chemical modifcation or conformational change, which we wish to record
in a \PDm. This information is captured via the
\sbgnclass{StateVariable}, as can be seen in figure
\ref{fig:statefulepnuml}). Replicated \sbgnclass{StatefulEPS}s are
indicated by the \glyph{Labelled Clone Marker} decoration. Note that
not all glyphs that are descendants of \sbgnclass{StatefulEPN} can be
cloned at all.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Changes from Previous Version}

Not defined in the previous version.

\subsection{Macromolecule}
\label{sec:macromolecule}

Many biological processes involve \emph{macromolecules}: biochemical
substances that are built up from the covalent linking of
pseudo-identical units.  Examples of macromolecules include proteins,
nucleic acids (RNA, DNA), and polysaccharides (glycogen, cellulose,
starch, etc.).  Attempting to define a separate glyph for all of these
different molecules would lead to an explosion of symbols in SBGN, so
instead, \SBGNPDLone defines only one glyph for all macromolecules.
The same glyph is to be used for a protein, a nucleic acid, a complex
sugar, and so on.  The exact nature of a particular macromolecule in a
map is then clarified using its label and decorations, as will become
clear below.  (Future levels of SBGN may subclass the
\glyph{macromolecule} and introduce different glyphs to differentiate
between types of macromolecules). This has two associated glyphs. One

\subsection{Complex}\label{sec:complex}
\label{defn:Complex}

A \sbgnclass{Complex} represents a biochemical entity composed of
other biochemical entities, whether macromolecules, simple chemicals,
multimers, or other complexes (figure
\ref{fig:complexsubunituml}). The \sbgnclass{Complex} can described
its composition by the set of \sbgnclass{Subunit}s it contains (see
figure \ref{sec:subunits}). This description is entirely optional and
is their to assist the user with a visual shorthand about the
composition of the complex.

\subsubsection{Special Rules and Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
\item Once a set of subunits are defined then they are always defined.
\item The set of subunits in the Complex does not identify it. One or
  more Complexes that contain the same set of subunits, but have
  different labels are \textbf{not} identical.

% \end{itemize}
% \end{glyphDescription}

\subsubsection{Notation}

The Complex is represented by two glyphs, the \glyph{Complex Monomer}
which represents a \sbgnclass{Complex} where the \attrib{cardinality}
is one and the \glyph{Complex Multimer} where the cardinality is
greater than that.

\paragraph{\glyph{Complex Monomer}}

\begin{glyphDescription}
\glyphSboTerm SBO:0000253 ! non-covalent complex
\glyphAux A \glyph{complex} can carry state variables (see \sect{stateVariable}).  The state of a complex is defined by the set of the all its state variable and all the state variables of all its components.  A \glyph{complex} can also carry one or several \glyph{units of information} (see \sect{unitInfo}). A \glyph{complex} may carry a \glyph{clone marker} (see \sect{cloneMarker}).
\glyphCloning Labeled Clone Marker
\glyphContainer A \glyph{complex} possesses its own container box surrounding the juxtaposed container boxes of its components.  This container box is a rectangle with cut-corners (an octagonal box with sides of two different lengths).  The size of the cut-corners are adjusted so that there is no overlap between the container and the components.  The container boxes of the components must not overlap.
\glyphLabel The identification of a \glyph{named complex} is carried
by an unbordered box containing a string of characters.  The
characters may be distributed on several lines to improve readability,
although this is not mandatory.  Ideally the label box should be
attached to the midway between the border of the complex's container
box and the border of the components' container boxes. However, if the
Complex contains Subunit glyphs then the label may be positions to
optimise the clarity and avoid overlapping.

\paragraph{Examples of complex EPNs}
\label{sec:CplxEPNs}

In this section, we provide examples of Entity Pool Node representations drawn using the \SBGNPDLone glyphs described above. 

\fig{example-camkii} represents calcium/calmodulin kinase II, with phosphorylation on the sites threonine 286 and 306, as well as catalytic and autoinhibitory domains.  Note the use of \emph{units of information} and \emph{state variables}.

  \caption{An example representation of calcium/calmodulin kinase II.}
  \label{fig:example-camkii}
\end{figure}

\fig{example-glur} represents the glutamate receptor in the open state, with both phosphorylation and glycosylation.  The entity carries two functional domains, the ligand-binding domain and the ion pore, and its chemical nature is precided.

  \caption{An example of a glutamate receptor in the open state.}
  \label{fig:example-glur}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Layout Rules and Guidelines}

\begin{itemize}
\item The subunits inside the complex must not overlap.
\item The subunits should sit above the clone marker so that they are
  not obscured by it.
\item The label should not be obscured by subunits or obscure them.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Changes from Previous Version}

\begin{itemize}
\item Clarified that complex must have a label and the label
  identifies the complex irrespective of its subunit composition.
\item The label positioning does not need to be at the centre of the
  Complex glyph.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Subunit}
\label{defn:Subunit}\label{sec:subunits}

A complex can optionally be decorated with subunit symbols
(\sbgnclass{Subunit} see figure \ref{fig:complexsubunituml}) to
describe the composition of the complex. The symbols available are
equivalent to those used by the EPN glyphs including the
\glyph{complex}. Therefore it is possible to describe complexes within
complexes. Subunits may contain labels.

\end{attributes}

\subsubsection{Rules and Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
\item Two or more state variables with the same name are
  permitted.
\item State variables with no name set are permitted.
\item Subunits can also contain subunits. There is no limit on such nesting. The namespace rules
  below apply.
\item Each state variable actually belongs to the Complex.
\item The subunit defines a namespace for its state variables, e.g.\,
  subunit ``A'' assigned a state variable ``P@Ser202''  and a subunit
  ``B'' assigned the same state variable can be distinguised as
  A:P@Ser202 and B:P@Ser202.
\item If the subunit is of type Complex then \attrib{children} can contain one or
  more \sbgnclass{Subunit} instances.
\item If the subunit has a cardinality $>1$ then this should be
  displayed by the \classref{AttributeValue}.
\item If \attrib{natures} contains one or more instances then these
  must be displayed via a \sbgnclass{AttributeValue}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Notation}

The example in figure \fig{complexSubunits} illustrates the use of
subunits in a complex shows an equivalent compex without
subunits. This is an import point. For every \glyph{Complex} drawn
with subunits it will always be possible to drawn an equivalent
version that does not use contains subunits.

The \sbgnclass{Process} (figure \ref{fig:processumlview}) represents a process that transforms one or
more entity pools into one or more entity pools, that are identical or
different. A process may be used to represent or summarise more than
one known process.  \SBGNPDLone defines a generic \glyph{process}
(\sect{process}), as well as five more specific ones: the
\glyph{omitted process} (\sect{omitted}), the \glyph{uncertain
  process} (\sect{uncertain}), the \glyph{association}
(\sect{association}), the \glyph{dissociation} (\sect{dissociation}),
and the \glyph{phenotype} (\sect{phenotype}).

\subsubsection{Changes from Previous Version}
\begin{itemize}
\item This was not explicitly defined in the previous version, but
  this version did define a glyph called \glyph{Process}. To avoid
  ambiguity this glyph has now been renamed \glyph{Stoichiometric
    Process} (see section \ref{sec:stoichiometricprocess}).
\item Previous specifications stated that processed could be
  duplicated when all associated EPNs were cloned. This behaviour has
  been changed the current status where all processes are unique in a \PDm.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{NonStoichiometricProcess}
\label{defn:NonStoichiometricProcess}

The \sbgnclass{NonStoichiometricProcess} (figure
\ref{fig:nonstoichprocessuml}) is a type of process. It does not
necessarily result in a measurable change of entity pools, nor does it
necessarily have a defined start and end point. In many cases the
process is not well defined. This may because it is not well
understood or because the detail is not important or is being
summarised.

\subsection{SubmapNode}
\label{sec:submap}\label{defn:SubmapNode}

The \sbgnclass{SubmapNode} ( figure \ref{fig:submapnodeuml} ) is a
placeholder for another process and is used when one wishes to hide
the detail of this process from the \PDm, but make it available to the
reader as a separate related map. The \sbgnclass{Submap} is not
equivalent to an \sbgnclass{OmittedProcess} (section
\ref{sec:omitted}). The \sbgnclass{Submap} allows the detail of
section of the \PDm to be exported to another \PDm and replaced by the
\sbgnclass{SubmapNode}, which acts as a place-holder.  This is
described in section \ref{sec:map} and the semantics of submap linking
is defined in section \ref{sec:submaplinkingsemantics}.

 The \sbgnclass{LogicalOperator} (figure \ref{fig:logicaloperatoruml} performs a Boolean operation on one or
more inputs to give a binary output. The input must be a Boolean
value, and are obtained from the \classref{LogicArc} connected to the
\sbgnclass{LogicOperator}. The output a two-value quantity,  0 for False and positive
non-zero for True. This is required because the output of the
\sbgnclass{LogicOperator} must be connected to either a
\sbgnclass{LogicArc} or a \classref{ModulationArc} both of which
require their out node to provide a quality. The behaviour of the
logical operator for each type of \attrib{operator\_type} is shown in
the following table:

\begin{tabular}[t]{c p{12cm}}
\toprule
AND & All inputs must be True for output to be True, otherwise output
is false.\\
OR & At least one input must be True for output to be True. If all
inputs are False then output is False.\\
NOT & Only one input is permitted and the output is the inversion of

\subsubsection{Changes from Previous Version}

Although the \sbgnclass{LogicOperator} was not explicitly defined in
the previous version the semantics and glyphs are unchanged.

\begin{figure}[htb]

  \includegraphics[width = 0.65\textwidth]{images/stoichprocessuml}
  \caption{The UML definition of the
    \sbgnclass{StiochiometricProcess}. The class interacts with
    subclasses of \sbgnclass{FluxArc} and \sbgnclass{ModulationArc}.}
  \label{fig:stoichprocessuml}
\end{figure}
 
A process that produces a measurable change in the quantities of
entity pools consumed and produced. In \PDl this is represented by the
\sbgnclass{StoichiometricProcess}. This type of process can be though
of as having a basal rate of governing the change in EPN quantities,
that is changed by other influences described by instances of
\classref{ModulationArc}. \sbgnclass{StoichiometricProcess} can be one
of several different types, which indicate the amount that is known
about the process or in some cases the nature of the process, for
example association and dissociation. The permitted values for
\attrib{process\_type} are described in the following table:

\begin{tabular}[c]{l p{12cm}}
\\\toprule
generic & A generic stoichiometric process that transforms a set of entity pools into another set of entity pools.\\
omitted & Omitted processes are processes that are known to exist, but are omitted from the map for the sake of clarity or parsimony. A single \glyph{omitted process} can represent any number of actual processes. The \glyph{omitted process} is different from a \glyph{submap}. While a \glyph{submap} references to an explicit content, that is hidden in the main map, the \glyph{omitted process} does not ``hide'' anything within the context of the map, and cannot be ``unfolded''.\\
uncertain & Uncertain processes are processes that may not exist. A single \glyph{uncertain process} can represent any number of actual processes.\\
association & The association between one or more \glyph{EPNs} represents the non-covalent binding of the biological objects represented by those \glyph{EPNs} into a larger complex.\\
dissociation & The dissociation of an \glyph{EPN} into one or more \glyph{EPNs} represents the rupture of a non-covalent binding between the biological entities represented by those \glyph{EPNs}.\\
\bottomrule\\
\end{tabular}\\


The \sbgnclass{StoichiometricProcess} describes a process that transforms a given set of biochemical entities---macromolecules, simple chemicals or unspecified entities---into another set of biochemical entities.  Such a transformation might imply modification of covalent bonds (conversion), modification of the relative position of constituents (conformational process) or movement from one compartment to another (translocation).

A cardinality label may be associated with \glyph{consumption} (\sect{consumption}) or \glyph{production} (\sect{production}) arcs to indicate the stoichiometry of the process.  This label becomes a requirement when the exact composition of the number of copies of the inputs or outputs to a reaction are ambiguous in the map.

A process is regarded as reversible if both `sides' of the process are
connected to \glyph{production} arcs (see section \ref{sec: semantics
  reversible procs}).The semantics of \glyph{modulation} is the same
as for irreversible processes, .i.e. the amount of entity in the
modulation pool affects the rate of the process.

When such a reversible process is asymmetrically modulated, it must be represented by two different processes in a \PD.  \fig{trans-mod} illustrates the use of two \glyph{process} nodes to represent the reversible activation of a G-protein coupled receptor.

The \sbgnclass{Compartment} is a logical or physical structure that
contains entity pool nodes. An \classref{EntityPoolNode} can only
belong to one compartment. Therefore, the ``same'' biochemical species
located in two different compartments are in fact two different pools.

\paragraph{Glyph: \glyph{Compartment}}\label{sec:compartment}

\begin{glyphDescription}

\glyphSboTerm  SBO:0000290 ! physical compartment 

\glyphContainer A compartment is represented by a surface enclosed in a continuous border or located between continuous borders. These borders should be noticeably thicker than the borders of the EPNs. A compartment can take \textbf{any} geometry. A compartment must always be entirely enclosed.

\glyphLabel The identification of the compartment is carried by an unbordered box containing a string of characters. The characters can be distributed on several lines to improve readability, although this is not mandatory. The label box can be attached anywhere in the container box. Note that the label can spill-over from the container box.

\glyphAux A \glyph{compartment} can carry a certain number of \glyph{units of information}, that will add information for instance about the physical environment, such as pH, temperature or voltage, see \sect{unitInfo}.  The center of the bounding box of a \glyph{unit of information} is located on the mid-line of the border of the compartment.

\end{glyphDescription}

\begin{figure}[H]

  \includegraphics[scale = 0.3]{images/compartment}
  \caption{The \PD glyph for \glyph{compartment}.}
  \label{fig:compartment}
\end{figure}


To allow more aesthetically pleasing and understandable maps, compartments are allowed to overlap each other visually, but it must be kept in mind that this does not mean the top compartment contains part of the bottom compartment.  \fig{overlap} shows two semantically equivalent placement of compartments:

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{examples/compartment_overlapping}
  \caption{Overlapped compartments are permitted, but the overlap does not imply containment.}
  \label{fig:overlap}
\end{figure}

Overlapped (hidden) part of the compartment should not contain any object which could be covered by an overlapping compartment.  \fig{overlap-bad} illustrates the problem using an incorrect map.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale = 0.45]{examples/compartment_overlapping_wrong}
  \caption{Example of an \textbf{incorrect} map.  Overlapped compartments must not obscure other objects.}
  \label{fig:overlap-bad}
\end{figure}

% It is important to note that a compartment never contains another compartment, but may surround it.  A key aspect of correctly drawing two ``adjacent'' compartments is that they are not separated by one line, but by \textbf{two} lines.  \fig{two-comp} provides an example of this in which a cell is shown made up of a nucleus surrounded by the cytoplasm.

% \begin{figure}[H]

%  \includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{examples/compartment-cell-wrong}
%   \caption{Compartments can surround other compartments; in that case, both of the compartment's borders must still be shown, with the result that the separation is drawn as two lines. The left example is correct, with twoo disjoint compartments representing the ``cytoplasm'' and the ``nucleus''. The right example is incorrect. Indeed the compartments ``cell'' and ``nucleus'' would be disjoint, the latter only overlapping the former. As a result, the volume of the nucleus is duplicated.}
%   \label{fig:two-comp}
% \end{figure}

% The example diagram in \fig{three-comp} represents three adjacent compartments.  Two of the compartments carry units of information.  Notice that these units of information do not overlap multiple membrane boundaries.

\end{figure}

 The \sbgnclass{AttributeValue} is used to present the values of
 certain attributes held by other SBGN elements. It is typically
 contained and owned by the class containing the attribute (or its
 descendants). It contains two values, one is a \attrib{code} to indicate the
 attribute that is defined and the other is the\attrib{ value} itself. The \attrib{code}
 and the presentation format of the \attrib{value} are defined by the
 SBGN element that contains the \sbgnclass{AttributeValue}, currently
 \classref{Compartment}, \classref{EntityPoolNode}, and \classref{Subunit}.

\end{attributes}

\subsubsection{Associations}

\subsubsection{Rules and Constraints}

No additional rules and constraints.

\subsubsection{Notation}

For historical reasons the \sbgnclass{AttributeValue} is represented
graphically by the glyph \glyph{Unit of Information}.

\paragraph{Glyph: \glyph{Unit of information}}
\label{sec:unitInfo}

When representing biological entities, it is often necessary to convey
some abstract information about the entity's function that cannot (or
does not need to) be easily related to its structure.  The \glyph{unit
  of information} is a decoration that can be used in this situation
to add information to a glyph.  Some example uses include:
characterizing a logical part of an entity such as a functional domain
(a binding domain, a catalytic site, a promoter, etc.), or the
information encoded in the entity (an exon, an open reading frame,
etc.).  A \glyph{unit of information} can also convey information
about the physical environment, or the specific type of biological
entity it is decorating.

\begin{glyphDescription}

\glyphSboTerm Not applicable.

\glyphContainer A unit of information is represented by a rectangle.  The long side of the rectangle should be oriented parallel to the border of the \glyph{EPN} being annotated by the \glyph{unit of information}. The center of the bounding box of a \glyph{state of information} should be located on the mid-line of the border of the \glyph{EPN}.

\glyphLabel A \glyph{unit of information} is identified by a label placed in an unbordered box containing a string of characters.  The characters can be distributed on several lines to improve readability, although this is not mandatory.  The label box must be attached to the center of the container.  The label may spill outside of the container.


%\glyphAux A \glyph{unit of information} does not carry any auxiliary items.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale = 0.3]{images/unitInformation}
  \caption{The \PD glyph for \glyph{unit of information}.}

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Changes from Previous Version}

There was no definition of the \sbgnclass{AttributeValue} in the
previous version of this specification. However, the \glyph{Unit of
  Information} did exist although its semantics have been changed. It
no longer can hold arbitrary annotation but must display an attribute
value and observe the constraints set out by the definition of the
class owning the attribute.

Since the use of the \glyph{Unit of Information} has been deprecated,
it is recommended that \classref{Annotation} and the
\glyph{Annotation} glyph is used instead.

\subsection{StateVariable}
\label{defn:StateVariable}

Many biological entities such as molecules can exist in different
\emph{states}, meaning different physical or informational
configurations.  These states can arise for a variety of reasons.  For
example, macromolecules can be subject to post-synthesis
modifications, wherein residues of the macromolecules (amino acids,
nucleosides, or glucid residues) are modified through covalent linkage
to other chemicals.  Other examples of states are alternative
conformations as in the closed/open/desensitized conformations of a
transmembrane channel, and the active/inactive forms of an enzyme.

SBGN provides a means of associating one or more
\sbgnclass{StateVariable} with an entity (figure
\ref{fig:statevariableviewuml}); each such variable can be used to
represent a dimension along which the state of the overall entity can
vary.  When an entity can exist in different states, the state of the
whole entity (\ie the SBGN object) can be described by the set of
\sbgnclass{StateVariable} instances it contains. Note that this is
true for the \classref{Complex} where any state variables are
associated visually with subunits (c.f \classref{Subunit}), but
actually belong to the complex (figure
\ref{fig:statevariableviewuml}).

\begin{glyphDescription}

\glyphSboTerm Not applicable.

\glyphContainer A \glyph{state variable} is represented by a
``stadium'' container, that is two hemicercles of same radius joined
by parallel segments, as shown in \fig{state-var}.  The parallel
segment axis should be tangent to the border of the glyph of the
\glyph{EPN} being modified by the \glyph{state variable}. The center
of the bounding box of a \glyph{state variable} should be located on
the mid-line of the border of the \glyph{EPN}. In previous versions of
this specification the \glyph{state variable} was represented by an
ellipse. This symbols is now \textbf{deprecated} in favour of the stadium
symbol described above. New \PD maps should not use the ellipse symbol.

\glyphLabel An unbordered box containing a string indicating the
contents of the \sbgnclass{StateVariable}. The style of labeling of
\glyph{State Variables} encouraged by \SBGNPDLone is to combine a
prefix representing the value of the variable with a suffix
representing the variable's name.  Prefix and suffix should be
separated by the symbol '@', X@Y thus meaning \emph{value X} AT
\emph{variable Y}. If \attrib{name} is undefined then only the value
should be displayed and the '@' character omitted.  If both the
\attrib{name} and \attrib{value} are undefined then the label should
be empty (\ie an empty string). The label of a \glyph{state variable}
should, if possible, be displayed within the boundary of the glyph. In
earlier versions of the SBGN specification it was permitted to
separate the \attrib{name} and \attrib{value} into two unlabelled
boxes and display the \attrib{name} box outside the \glyph{state
  variable} glyph. This is now \textbf{deprecated} and new \PD maps
should not use this notation.


% The identification of an instance of a \glyph{state variable} is carried by one or two unbordered boxes, each containing a string of characters.  The characters cannot be distributed on several lines.  One box is mandatory, and contains the value of the \glyph{state variable}.  The value may be empty; an example of a situation where this might arise is an unphosphorylated phosporylation site.  The second box is optional and carries the identification of the \glyph{state variable}. The center of the combination of the boxes located in the container box is superposed to the center of this container box.  In earier version of the \PD specification, the identification of the \glyph{state variable} could be located outside the \glyph{state variable} container box.  This is now forbidden.  The style of labeling of \glyph{state variables} encouraged by \SBGNPDLone is to combine a prefix representing the value of the variable with a suffix representing the variable's name.  Prefix and suffix should be separated by the symbol '@', X@Y thus meaning \emph{value X} AT \emph{variable Y}. The label of a \glyph{state variable} should, if possible, be displayed within the boundary of the glyph.

\glyphAux A \glyph{state variable} does not carry any auxiliary items.

  \label{fig:state-var}
\end{figure}

A \glyph{state variable} does not necessarily have to be
Boolean-valued.  For example, an ion channel can possess several
conductance states; a receptor can be inactive, active and
desensitized; and so on.  As another example, a \glyph{state variable}
``ubiquitin'' could also carry numerical values corresponding to the
number of ubiquitin molecules present in the tail.  However, in all
cases, a \glyph{state variable} on an EPN can only take \emph{one}
defined value.  Further, an EPN's \glyph{state variable} should always
be displayed and always set to a value.  An ``empty'' \glyph{state
  variable} is a \glyph{state variable} that is set to the value
``unset'', it is not a \glyph{state variable} with no value. Note that
the value ``unset'' is \emph{not} synonymous to ``any value'' or
``unknown value''.


\subsubsection{Changes from Previous Version}

The \sbgnclass{StateVariable} class was not explicitly defined in
previous versions of the specification, however the \glyph{state
  variable} was. Some aspects of its notation have been deprecated and
these are detailed above (section \ref{sec:stateVariable}).

\subsection{Annotation}
\label{defn:Annotation}

In \SBGNPDLone there are cases where the language does not capture
everything the author wishes to convey. This may be additional
experimental detail or descriptions of mechanisms that cannot be
described full by the \PDl. In this case the language provides the
\sbgnclass{Annotation}. This contains text and is associated with a
particular glyph in a map. Importantly, it is purely ``decoration''
and does alter the meaning the map.

via a callout (see figure \ref{fig:ex-annotation}. The callout should
overlap with the object it is annotating.

\glyphLabel An \glyph{annotation} contains information placed in an unbordered box containing a string of characters.  The characters can be distributed on several lines to improve readability, although this is not mandatory.  The label box must be attached to the center of the container.

The \sbgnclass{FluxArc} permits a quantity of entities to flow through
the arc and in doing so connects a stoichiometric process
(\classref{StoichiometricProcess}) and an EPN
(\classref{EntityPoolNode}). The arc has a stoichiometry which affects
the flow through the arc. So for example a stoichiometry of $2n$
permits twice as many entities through as one of $n$.

\item The \sbgnclass{EntityPoolNode}s that make up the LHS of the

  constitute a balanced biochemical reaction.
\item Once the stoichiometry of a \sbgnclass{FluxArc} is displayed in a map then
  all other \sbgnclass{FluxArc}s should display their stoichiometry label.
\item If the stoichiometry is undefined or unknown this should be

\subsubsection{Notation}

\paragraph{Stoichiometry Label}

The stoichiometry label is part of the \glyph{consumption arc} and
\glyph{production arc} glyphs see below (sections
\ref{sec:consumption} and \ref{sec:production}). However, as their use
is common to all subclasses of \sbgnclass{FluxArc} their presentation
is described here.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{Examples of stoichiometry label layout. In figure (a) the
    label is aligned with the stoichiometry box, while in (b) the

    arc is curved, the corners at the base of the label are anchored
    to point on the arc (c) and the label is drawn over the arc
    (d). Note that in (d) the covered part of the arc is shown for

\subsubsection{Notation}

\paragraph{Glyph: \glyph{Consumption}}
\label{sec:consumption}

\glyph{Consumption} is the arc used to represent the fact that an entity pool is consumed by a process,
but is not produced by the process.

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \glyphSboTerm SBO:0000394 ! consumption.
 \glyphOrigin Any \glyph{EPN} (\sect{EPNs}).
 \glyphTarget Any \glyph{process node} (\sect{PNs}).
 \glyphEndPoint No particular symbol is used to represent a consumption.
\end{glyphDescription}


A cardinality label may be associated with \glyph{consumption}
(\sect{consumption}) or \glyph{production} (\sect{production}) arcs,
indicating the stoichiometry of a process. This label is a number
enclosed in a rectangle with one of the long sides adjacent to the
consumption arc. The cardinality is required to eliminate ambiguity
when the exact composition, or the number of copies, of the inputs or
outputs to a reaction are ambiguous from the map.  An example is a
multimer of 6 subunits dissociating into 2 monomers and 2
dimers. Without stoichiometry labels another result, such as 4
monomers and 1 dimer could be inferred.  Once assigned to one arc
connecting to a process node, cardinality should be represented on all
\glyph{consumption} and \glyph{production} arcs connected to that
process node to avoid misinterpretation.

Omitted cardinality on one edge only should not be treated as cardinality of 1, but
as an unspecified cardinality. In most cases, the exact value may be derived from the
context, but unless cardinality is explicitly shown, it should be considered as
unspecified. In the case where the stoichiometry of some part of the process is not
known, or undefined, a question mark (?) should be used within the cardinality label
of the corresponding arcs.

\paragraph{Glyph: \glyph{Production}}\label{sec:production}

\glyph{Production} is the arc used to represent the fact that an entity pool is 
produced by a process. In the case of a reversible process, the 
\glyph{production} arc also acts as a \glyph{consumption} arc.

\begin{glyphDescription}

  \label{fig:modulationarcuml}
\end{figure}
 
The \sbgnclass{ModulationArc} (figure \ref{fig:modulationarcuml})
affects the flux of a process represented by the target process. Such
a modulation can affect the process \textbf{positively or negatively},
or even both ways depending on the conditions, for instance the
concentration of the intervening participants. The permitted values
for \attrib{process\_type} are described in the following table:

\begin{tabular}[c]{l p{12cm}}
\\\toprule
modulation & A general modulation where the exact nature of the
modulation is not specified or not known. Modulation can be used when one does not know the precise
direction of the effect.\\
stimulation & A stimulation affects \textbf{positively} the flux of a process represented by the target process. This stimulation can be for instance a catalysis or a positive allosteric regulation. Note that \glyph{catalysis} exists independently in SBGN, see \sect{catalysis}.\\
catalysis & A particular case of stimulation, where the effector affects
positively the flux of a process represented by the target process. The positive effect on the process is due to the lowering of the activation energy of a reaction.\\
inhibition & An inhibition \textbf{negatively} affects the flux of a process represented by the target process. This inhibition can be for instance a competitive inhibition or an allosteric inhibition.\\
necessary\_stim & A necessary stimulation, is one that is necessary for a process to take place. A process modulated by a necessary stimulation can only occur when this necessary stimulation is active.\\
\bottomrule\\
\end{tabular}\\

As discussed in \chap{concepts}, it is implied, but not defined explicitly that the process has a rate at
which it converts its LHS EPNs to its RHS EPNs (and vice-versa in the case of a reversible process). This concept is
important in understanding how the \PDl describes process modulation.

\begin{enumerate}
\item A \glyph{process} with no modulations has an underlying ``basal rate''
  which describes the rate at which it converts inputs to outputs.
\item A \glyph{modulation} changes the basal rate in an unspecified fashion.
\item A \glyph{stimulation} is a modulation that increases the basal rate.
\item An \glyph{inhibition} is a modulation that decreases the basal rate.
\item The above types of modulation, when assigned to the same process, are combined and have a multiplicative effect on the basal rate of the process.
\item Modulators that do not interact with each other in the above manner, should be drawn as modulating different process nodes. Their effect is therefore additive.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Attributes}

\subsubsection{Associations}

\begin{attributes}
\associtem{states}{StateVariable}{*} The state variables

\end{attributes}

\subsubsection{Rules and Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
\item At most one \glyph{necessary stimulation} can be assigned to a process node. Two \glyph{necessary stimulations}
  would imply an implicit AND or OR operator. For clarity only
  one \glyph{necessary stimulation} can be assigned to a \glyph{process}, and such combinations must be
  explicitly expressed using \glyph{logical operators}. 
\item At most one \glyph{catalysis} can be assigned to a
  \glyph{process}. Modulation by a catalysis arc implies that the exact biochemical mechanism underlying
  the process is known. In this context two \glyph{catalysis} cannot
  be assigned to the same process node as they represent
  independent reactions. Other EPNs can be assigned to the same process as a catalysis, such as modulators, stimulators, and
  inhibitors, and will have a multiplicative modulation on the reaction rate defined by the catalysis.
\end{itemize}

The \sbgnclass{ModulationArc} is represented by a number of glyphs

The example in \fig{necessary_stim-gene} below describes the
transcription of a gene~X, that is the creation of a messenger RNA~X
triggered by the gene~X.  The creation of the protein~X is then
triggered by the mRNA~X.  (Note that the same example could be

semantically different.)

transport of calcium ions out of the endoplasmic reticulum. Without
IP3 receptor, there is not calcium flux, therefore, one cannot use a

The definition of \sbgnclass{ModulationArc} did not exist in the
previous version but there has been no changes to the glyphs and glyph
semantics in this version.

\subsection{LogicArc}
\label{defn:LogicArc}

The \sbgnclass{LogicArc} (figure \ref{fig:logicarcuml}) takes a quantity from either a
\classref{LogicalOperator} or an \classref{EntityPoolNode} and
converts it into a Boolean output, which serves as an input for a
\classref{LogicalOperator}. How this is done is not defined, but one
could imagine that when a threshold value of the quantity is exceeded
the output is True.

\subsection{CloneMarker}

    and \sbgnclass{Subunit}.}
  \label{fig:clonemarkeruml}
\end{figure}

If an \classref{EntityPoolNode} is duplicated on a map, it is
necessary to indicate this fact by the \sbgnclass{CloneMarker}
auxiliary unit (figure \ref{fig:clonemarkeruml}).  The purpose of this
marker is to provide the reader with a visual indication that this
node has been cloned, and that at least one other occurrence of the
\sbgnclass{EntityPoolNode} can be found in the map (or in a submap;
see \sect{submap}).  The clone marker takes two forms, simple and
labeled, depending on whether the node being cloned can carry state
variables (\ie whether it is a stateful EPN). Note that an
\sbgnclass{EntityPoolNode} belongs to a single compartment. If two
classes named ``X'' are located in two different compartments, such as
ATP in cytosol and ATP in mitochondrial lumen, they represent
different Entity Pools, and therefore do not need to be marked as
cloned.

\subsection{SimpleCloneMarker}

The \sbgnclass{SimpleCloneMarker} (figure \ref{fig:clonemarkeruml}) is
the unlabelled subclass \sbgnclass{CloneMarker}. All duplicated

\paragraph{Simple clone marker}

\begin{glyphDescription}

\glyphSboTerm Not applicable.

\glyphContainer The simple (unlabeled) \glyph{clone marker} is a
portion of the surface of an \glyph{EPN} that has been modified
visually through the use of a different shade, texture, or color.
\fig{simpleCloneMarker} illustrates this.  The \glyph{clone marker}
occupies the lower part of the \glyph{EPN}. The filled area must be
smaller than the unfilled one.

\glyphLabel Not applicable.

\glyphAux A \glyph{clone marker} does not carry any auxiliary items.

  \label{fig:simpleCloneMarker}
\end{figure}

\fig{example-cloning} contains an example in which we illustrate the use of \glyph{clone markers} to clone the species ATP and ADP participating in different reactions.  This example also demonstrates the chief drawbacks of using clones: it leads to a kind of dissociation of the overall network and multiplies the number of nodes required, requiring more work on the part of the reader to interpret the result.  Sometimes these disadvantages are offset in larger maps by a reduction in the overall number of line crossings, but not always.  In general, we advise that cloning should be used sparingly.

\subsection{LabelledClonerMarker}
\label{defn:LabelledCloneMarker}

Unlike the classref{SimpleCloneMarker}, the
\sbgnclass{LabeledCloneMarker} (figure \ref{fig:clonemarkeruml})
includes (unsurprisingly, given its name) an identifying label that
can be used to identify equivalent clones elsewhere in the map.  This
is particularly useful for subclasses of \classref{StatefulEPN},
because these can have a large number of state variables displayed and
therefore may be difficult to visually identify as being identical.

\subsubsection{Generalisation}

\begin{itemize}
\item \classref{CloneMarker}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Attributes}

\begin{attributes}
  \attitem{label}{string}{R} The label that identified the clone. This
  label must start and end with an alphanumeric character, and cannot
  contain white space.

\subsubsection{Associations}

No additional associations.

\subsubsection{Rules and Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
\item At least two or more instanced of a
  \sbgnclass{LabelledCloneMarker} with the same \attrib{label} must
  exist in this same in a given \classref{Map}.
\item Only subclasses of \classref{StatefulEPN} can contain
labelled clone markers.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Notation}

\paragraph{Labeled clone marker}

\begin{glyphDescription}

\glyphSboTerm Not applicable.

\glyphContainer The labeled \glyph{clone marker} is a portion of the surface of an \glyph{EPN} that has been modified visually through the use of a different shade, texture, or color.  The \glyph{clone marker} occupies the lower part of the EPN glyph. The filled area must be smaller than the unfilled one, but the be large enough to have a height larger than the \glyph{clone marker}'s label (cf below).  

\glyphLabel A \glyph{clone marker} is identified by a label placed in an unbordered box containing a string of characters.  The characters can be distributed on several lines to improve readability, although this is not mandatory.  The label box must be attached to the center of the container.  The label may spill outside of the container (the portion of the surface of the EPN that has been modified visually).  The font color of the label and the color of the clone marker should contrast with one another.  The label on a \glyph{labeled clone marker} is mandatory.

\glyphAux A \glyph{clone marker} does not carry any auxiliary items.

\section{Controlled vocabularies}\label{sec:CVs}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%                   Controlled vocabularies
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Some classes in the SBGN \PDl can contain particular kinds of textual
annotation conveying information relevant to the class.  Examples are
the \attrib{natures} of an \classref{EntityPoolNode} or
\classref{Compartment} or the \attrib{value} of the
\classref{StateVariable}. The values held by these attributes can be
taken from controlled vocabularies defined below. When displayed in
some cases is mandatory to prefix a code indicating the type of
controlled vocabulary used.  This is in order to make it clear what
the information is that the value referes to: for example 'mt'
indicates that a value 'rna' is describing the material RNA.

In the rest of this section, we describe the controlled vocabularies
(CVs) used in \SBGNPDLone.  They cover the following categories of
information: an EPN's material type, an EPN's conceptual type,
covalent modifications on macromolecules and the physical
characteristics. These controlled vocabularies are \emph{closed} in
the sense that only the values defined for each CV can be used in a
valid \PDm and also closed because only the controlled vocabularies
defined in this specification can be used in a valid \PDm. We
understand that this is of necessity restrictive, but in closing these
definitions it means we can be clear about the meaning of all CV terms
used in the specification. Updates to the CV terms and the CVs used
are welcome and we encourage any changes or additions to be submitted
as a tracker item at the address given on the front page of this
specification.


\subsection{Entity pool node material types}
\label{sec:material-types-cv}

The material type of an EPN indicates its chemical structure.  A list
of common material types is shown in \tab{material-types-cv}, but
others are possible.  The values are to be taken from the \sbo
(\sbourl), specifically from the branch having identifier
\sboid{SBO:0000240} ($\!$\emph{material entity} under \emph{entity}).
The labels are defined by \SBGNPDLone.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l>{\ttfamily}l>{\ttfamily}l}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Name}              & \textbf{\rmfamily Label} & \textbf{\rmfamily SBO term} \\
    \midrule
    Non-macromolecular ion     & mt:ion  & SBO:0000327\\
    Non-macromolecular radical & mt:rad  & SBO:0000328\\
    Ribonucleic acid           & mt:rna  & SBO:0000250\\
    Deoxribonucleic acid       & mt:dna  & SBO:0000251\\
    Protein                    & mt:prot & SBO:0000297\\
    Polysaccharide             & mt:psac & SBO:0000249\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{A sample of values from the \emph{material types} controlled
    vocabulary (\sect{material-types-cv}).}
  \label{tab:material-types-cv}
\end{table}

The material types are in contrast to the \emph{conceptual types} (see
below).  The distinction is that material types are about physical
composition, while conceptual types are about roles.  For example, a
strand of RNA is a physical artifact, but its use as messenger RNA is
a role.


\subsection{Entity pool node conceptual types}
\label{sec:conceptual-types-cv}

An EPN's \emph{conceptual type} indicates its function within the
context of a given \PD.  A list of common conceptual types is shown in
\tab{conceptual-types-cv}, but others are possible.  The values are to
be taken from the \sbo (\sbourl), specifically from the branch having
identifier \sboid{SBO:0000241} ($\!$\emph{conceptual entity} under
\emph{entity}).  The labels are defined by \SBGNPDLone.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l>{\ttfamily}l>{\ttfamily}l}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Name}              & \textbf{\rmfamily Label} & \textbf{\rmfamily SBO term} \\

    Gene coding region        & ct:coding & SBO:0000335\\
    Gene regulatory region    & ct:grr    & SBO:0000369\\
    Messenger RNA             & ct:mRNA   & SBO:0000278\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{A sample of values from the \emph{conceptual types} vocabulary
    (\sect{conceptual-types-cv}).}
  \label{tab:conceptual-types-cv}
\end{table}


\subsection{Macromolecule covalent modifications}
\label{sec:covalent-mod-cv}

A common reason for the introduction of state variables
(\sect{stateVariable}) on an entity is to allow access to the
configuration of possible covalent modification sites on that entity.
For instance, a macromolecule may have one or more sites where a
phosphate group may be attached; this change in the site's
configuration (\ie being either phosphorylated or not) may factor into
whether, and how, the entity can participate in different processes.
Being able to describe such modifications in a consistent fashion is
the motivation for the existence of SBGN's covalent modifications
controlled vocabulary.

\tab{covalent-mod-cv} lists a number of common types of covalent
modifications.  The most common values are defined by the \sbo in the
branch having identifier \sboid{SBO:0000210} (\emph{addition of a
  chemical group} under
\emph{interaction}$\rightarrow$\emph{process}$\rightarrow$\emph{biochemical
  or transport reaction}$\rightarrow$\\\emph{biochemical
  reaction}$\rightarrow$\emph{conversion}).  The labels shown in
\tab{covalent-mod-cv} are defined by \SBGNPDLone; for all other kinds
of modifications not listed here, the author of a \PD must create a
new label (and should also describe the meaning of the label in a
legend or text accompanying the map).

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l>{\ttfamily}l>{\ttfamily}l}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Name}   & \textbf{\rmfamily Label} & \textbf{\rmfamily SBO term} \\

  \label{tab:covalent-mod-cv}
\end{table}


\subsection{Physical characteristics}
\label{sec:physical-characteristics-cv}

\SBGNPDLone defines a special unit of information for describing
certain common physical characteristics.
\tab{physical-characteristics-cv} lists the particular values defined
by \SBGNPDLone.


\begin{table}[h]

\section{Entity Pool Node Identity and Cloning}
\label{sec:epnuniqueness}
\label{sec:uniquenessdefinition}

All elements in an SBGN \PDm have an implicit identify defined by the
\attrib{id} attribute in \classref{SBGNElement} so in that respect all
elements drawn are unique. However, in some cases it is possible to
draw two or elements that define identical information in the map. In
some clases, such as the \sbgnclass{Compartment} this is prohibited, but in
others (\sbgnclass{EntityPoolNode}) it is not, but requires
special decoration (the clone marker) to indicate that the information
is replicated on the map. We define this type of identity and
``logical identity'' and the attributes that so discriminate between
elements as the ``logical key''.

Clearly it is therefore important that we define the logical key for
all the elements in the map and that we do this for the class definitions
(section \ref{sec:definitions}). The conventions used for this is as
follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item If no logical key is specified then instance identity applies
  (see above).
\item If the logical key is defined then this should be applied when
  determining equality between two elements.
\item If an element can be replicated and two elements are determined
  to be logically identical, then instance identity should be used to
  determine uniqueness.
\item If an element can be replicated if marked as a clone, then the
  above rule applies. If the element is not marked as cloned, then the
  only the logical key can be used when determining uniqueness.
\end{itemize}

\fig{cloningrules-eg} illustrates how the above rules are applied in
practise in the \PDm. They also affect our understanding when reading
a map. For example since all processes are unique, two \glyph{Process}
glyphs connected to the same input and output indicates that the same
``reaction'' can be carried out by two distinct processes, with
potentially different mechanisms.

\section{Map and Submap Linking}
\label{sec:mapsubmaps}
\label{sec:submaplinkingsemantics}

Rules.

\begin{itemize}
\item Same namespace for map and submaps. Recursive so submaps of
  submaps share top-most map's namespace. \textbf{Do we want to allow this?}
\item Compartment's logical key is it's name. Compartment's can be
  replicated across submaps and they all refer to the same
  compartment.
\item EPNs replicated in both map and immediate submap must be
  associated with a cross-reference (terminal for main map, tag for
  submap).
\item EPN replication is allowed between submaps separated by one or more other
  submaps, i.e. those not affected by the above rule.
\item All \attrib{reference\_id}s used must be unique within a given
  map and it's immediate super-map and its immediate sub-map.
\item submap folding: all tagged nodes in submap merge with those
  linked to terminals in super-map. If either node is cloned then all
  equivalent nodes in merged map must share the appropriate clone
  marker.
\end{itemize}

The submap is a visual device that allows the detail of an \PD map to
be exported into another \PD map and replaced by a \glyph{submap}
glyph, which acts as a place-holder. This is described and illustrated
in \sect{submap}. In the following discussion we will refer to the
original map as the \emph{main} map and the map containing the export
detail as the submap.

\begin{enumerate}
\item For a valid mapping between an EPN in the map and submap to
  exist the identifiers in the \glyph{tag} and the submap terminal
  must be identical and their associated entity pool nodes must be
  identical.
\item If the same EPN is present in the map and a submap, then they
  must be mapped to each other.
\item Since the main map and submap share the same namespace, an EPN
  that is cloned in the main map must also be marked as cloned in the
  submap --- even if there is only one copy of the EPN in the
  submap. The converse applies when the EPN in the submap is
  cloned\footnote{This has the additional benefit of ensuring that
    main maps and submaps do not need to be modified if the submap is
    exanded and collapsed by a viewing or editing tool.}.
\end{enumerate}



A \sbgnclass{Submap} is used to encapsulate processes (including all
types of nodes and edges) one glyph.  The \glyph{submap} hides its
content to the users, and display only input terminals (or ports),
linked to \glyph{EPNs} (\sect{EPNs}).  A \glyph{submap} is not
equivalent to an \glyph{omitted process} (see \sect{omitted}).  In the
case of an SBGN description that is made available through a software
tool, the content of a \glyph{submap} may be available to the tool.  A
user could then ask the tool to expand the \glyph{submap}, for
instance by clicking on the icon representing the \glyph{submap}.  The
tool might then expand and show the \glyph{submap} within the same map
(on the same canvas), or it might open it in a different canvas. In
the case of an SBGN description made available in a book or a website,
the content of the \glyph{submap} may be available on another page,
possibly accessible via an hyperlink on the \glyph{submap}.

\fig{submap-folded} represents a \glyph{submap} that transforms
glucose into fructose-6-phosphate. The \glyph{submap} carries five
terminals, four linked to EPNs and one linked to a
\glyph{compartment}.  The latter is particularly important in the case
of EPNs present only in a \glyph{compartment} enclosed in a
\glyph{submap}, and that are not linked to terminals themselves.  Note
that the terminals do not define a ``direction'', such as input or
output.  The flux of the reactions is determined by the context.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{examples/submap-folded}
  \caption{Example of a submap with contents elided.}
  \label{fig:submap-folded}
\end{figure}

The map in \fig{submap-unfolded} represents an unfolded version of a
\glyph{submap}.  Here, anything outside the \glyph{submap} has
disappeared, and the internal \glyph{tags} are not linked to the
corresponding external \glyph{terminals}.  Note the tag 5, linking the
compartment ``mito'' of the \glyph{submap} to the compartment ``mito''
outside the \glyph{submap}.  The compartment containing Glu6P is
implicitly defined as the same as the compartment containing Glu and
Fru6P.  There is no ambiguity because if Glu and Fru6P were in
different compartments, one of them should have been defined within
the \glyph{submap}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale = 0.35]{examples/submap-dissociated}
  \caption{Example of an unfolded submap. The unfolded submap corresponds to the folded submap of \fig{submap-folded}.}
  \label{fig:submap-unfolded}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Compartment spanning}

An \glyph{EPN} cannot \emph{belong} to more than one
\glyph{compartment}. However, an EPN can be \emph{drawn} over more than one
\glyph{compartment}. In such cases, the decision on which is the owning
\glyph{compartment} is deferred to the drawing tool or the
author. A \glyph{complex} may contain EPNs which belong to different
\glyph{compartments} and in this way a \glyph{complex} can be used to describe
entities that span more than one {compartment}.

This restriction makes it impossible to represent in a semantically
correct way a macromolecule that spans more then one compartment ---
for example a receptor protein. It is clearly desirable to be able to
show a macromolecule in a manner that the biologist expects (i.e.\,
spanning from the outside through the membrane to the
inside). Therefore, the author is recommended to draw the
macromolecule across compartment boundaries, but the underlying SBGN
semantic model will assign it to only one. The assignment to a
\glyph{compartment} may be decided by the software drawing tool or the
author. Note that this has implications for auto-layout algorithms as
they will only be able to treat such \glyph{entity pool nodes} as contained within
a \glyph{compartment} and will have no way of knowing a macromolecule spans a
compartment.

The current solution is consistent with other Systems Biology
representations such as SBML and BioPAX. For more information about the
problems representing membrane spanning proteins and the rationale
behind the current solution see \sect{postponed}.
