\chapter{Validation and consistency rules}

\newcommand{\validationRule}     [1]{\item[#1.~]\input{validation-rules/#1.tex}}

This section describes criteria that must be met by the diagram (or SBGN-ML diagram description) to conform
\SBGNPDLone specification. 

All criteria has unique and perennial numbering. In the case when modification of the specification makes a rule
irrelevant it will be deleted but the number of the rule will not be taken, so there will be gaps in rule numbering.

\section{EPN rules} 
\begin{enumerate}
\validationRule{000001}
\validationRule{000002}
\validationRule{000003}
\end{enumerate}
