\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Production}}\label{sec:production}

\glyph{Production} is the arc used to represent the fact that an entity is 
produced by a process. In the case of a reversible transition, the 
\glyph{production} arc also acts as a \glyph{consumption} arc.

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \glyphSboTerm To be determined.
 \glyphOrigin Any \glyph{process node} (\sect{PNs}).
 \glyphTarget Any EPN (\sect{EPNs}).
 \glyphEndPoint The target extremity of a \glyph{production} carries a filled arrowhead.
 \end{glyphDescription}

A cardinality label can be associated with a \glyph{production} arc indicating the stoichiometry of a process.

\fig{prod-card} illustrates the use of consumption/production arc cardinality labels to represent the stoichiometry of a process.
