\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{And}}\label{sec:and}

The glyph \glyph{and} is used to denote that all the \glyph{EPNs} linked as input are necessary to produce the output.  

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \glyphSboTerm SBO:0000173 ! and.
 \glyphOrigin More than one EPN (section~\ref{sec:EPNs}) or logical operator (section~\ref{sec:logic}).
 \glyphTarget  One modulation (section~\ref{sec:modulation}), stimulation (section~\ref{sec:stimulation}), catalysis (section~\ref{sec:catalysis}), inhibition (section~\ref{sec:inhibition}) or necessary stimulation (section~\ref{sec:necessary_stim}) arc.
