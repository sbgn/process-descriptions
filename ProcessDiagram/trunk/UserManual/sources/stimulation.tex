\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Stimulation}}\label{sec:stimulation}

A stimulation affects \textbf{positively} the flux of a process represented by the target process. This stimulation can be for instance a catalysis or a positive allosteric regulation. Note that \glyph{catalysis} exists independently in SBGN, see \sect{catalysis}. The target extremity of a \glyph{stimulation} carries an empty arrowhead.
