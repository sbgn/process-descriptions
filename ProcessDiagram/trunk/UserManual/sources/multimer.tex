\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Multimer}}
\label{sec:multimer}

As its name implies, a multimer is an aggregation of multiple identical or pseudo-identical entities held together by non-covalent bonds. Thus, they are distinguished from polymers by the fact that the latter involve covalent bonds, and should be represented by \glyphs{macromolecules}. Here \emph{pseudo-identical} refers to the possibility that the entities differ chemically but retain some common global characteristic, such as a structure or function, and so can be considered identical within the context of the SBGN \PD.  An example of this are the homologous subunits in a hetero-oligomeric receptor. SBGN \PD accepts multimers of \glyph{simple chemical} (\sect{simpleChemical}), \glyph{macromolecule} (\sect{macromolecule}), \glyph{nucleic acid feature} (\sect{genetic}) or \glyph{complex} (\sect{complex}). A \glyph{multimer} is represented by two identical containers shifted horizontally and vertically and stacked one on top of the other as illustrated in \fig{multimer}.
