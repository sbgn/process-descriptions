\chapter{Introduction}

%Here put a general but short introduction to the needs of standardizing the representation of pathways.

The goal of the \textbf{S}ystems \textbf{B}iology \textbf{G}raphical 
\textbf{N}otation (SBGN) is to standardize the graphical/visual 
representation of biochemical and cellular processes. SBGN 
defines comprehensive sets of symbols with precise semantics, together with 
detailed syntactic rules defining their use.  It also describes the manner 
in which such graphical information should be interpreted \cite{LeNovere:2009p1}. 

% Brief introduction to the three languages.

This document describes the graphical elements composing the \emph{\PDl{}} of SBGN. 

% Here put a brief version of the introduction present in the glyph section of the PD specification.

\section{SBGN levels and versions}
\label{sec:sbgn-levels}

It was clear at the outset of SBGN development that it would be impossible 
to design a perfect and complete notation right from the beginning.  Apart 
from the prescience this would require (which, sadly, none of the authors 
possess), it also would likely need a vast language that most newcomers 
would shun as being too complex.  Thus, the SBGN community followed an idea 
used in the development of other standards, i.e. stratify language 
development into levels.

A \emph{level} of one of the SBGN languages represents a set of
features deemed to fit together cohesively, constituting a usable set
of functionality that the user community agrees is sufficient for a
reasonable set of tasks and goals.  Within \emph{levels},
\emph{versions} represent small evolution of a language, that may
involve new glyphs, refined semantics, but no fundamental change of
the way maps are to be generated and interpreted. In addition new
versions should be backwards compatible, \ie \PD maps that conform to
an earlier version of the \PDl within the same level should still be
valid.  This does not apply to a new levels. 

Capabilities and features that cannot be agreed upon and are judged
insufficiently critical to require inclusion in a given level, are
postponed to a higher level or version.  In this way, the development
of SBGN languages is envisioned to proceed in stages, with each higher
levels adding richness compared to the levels below it.
