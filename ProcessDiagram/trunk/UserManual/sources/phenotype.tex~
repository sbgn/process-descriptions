\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Phenotype}}
\label{sec:phenotype}

A biochemical network can generate phenotypes or affect biological
processes.  Such processes can take place at different levels and are
independent of the biochemical network itself.  To represent these
processes in a map, SBGN defines the \glyph{phenotype} glyph, which describes a process consuming nothing and producing nothing, but only modulated. A \glyph{phenotype} is represented by an hexagone, as illustrated in \fig{phenotype}.

The example in \fig{phenotype-MPF} illustrates the use of a \glyph{phenotype} node to represent cell division, stimulated by the mono-phosphorylated form of the maturation promoting factor.
