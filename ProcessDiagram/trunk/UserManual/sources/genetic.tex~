\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Nucleic acid feature}}
\label{sec:genetic}

The \emph{Nucleic acid feature} construct in SBGN is meant to represent a fragment of a macromolecule carrying genetic information.  A common use for this construct is to represent a gene or a transcript.  The label of this EPN and its \emph{units of information} (see \sect{unitInfo}) are often important for making the purpose clear to the reader of a map. A \glyph{nucleic acid feature} is represented by a rectangular container whose bottom half has rounded corners, as shown in \fig{genetic}. This design reminds that we are fundamentally dealing with a unit of information, but this information is carried by a macromolecule.
