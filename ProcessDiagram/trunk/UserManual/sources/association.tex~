\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Association}}\label{sec:association}

The association between one or more \glyph{EPNs} represents the non-covalent binding of the biological objects represented by those \glyph{EPNs} into a larger complex. An \glyph{association} between several entities is represented by a filled disc linked to two connectors separated by 180 degrees. The consumption (\sect{consumption}) and production (\sect{production}) arcs are linked to the extremities of those connectors. An \glyph{association} is never reversible, the inverse process being represented by a \glyph{dissociation} (\sect{dissociation}).

The example in \fig{assoc-cyclin} illustrates the association of cyclin and CDC2 kinase into the Maturation Promoting Factor.

An \glyph{association} does not necessarily involve components of the same nature. \fig{assoc-unamed} gives an example illustrating the association of a pentameric \glyph{macromolecule} (a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) with a \glyph{simple chemical} (the local anesthetic chlorpromazin) in an unnamed complex.

An association does not necessarily result in the formation of a \glyph{complex}; it can also produce a \glyph{multimer}. \fig{assoc-multi} gives an example of using the successive formation of an hemoglobin monomer then a tetramer of the resulting complex.
