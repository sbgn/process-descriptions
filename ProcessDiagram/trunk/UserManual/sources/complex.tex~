\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Complex}}\label{sec:complex}

A \glyph{complex} node represents a biochemical entity composed of other biochemical entities, whether macromolecules, simple chemicals, multimers, or other complexes. The resulting entity may have its own identity, properties and function in an SBGN map. A \glyph{complex} possesses its own container box surrounding the juxtaposed container boxes of its components.  This container box is a rectangle with cut-corners (an octagonal box with sides of two different lengths).  The size of the cut-corners are adjusted so that there is no overlap between the container and the components.  The container boxes of the components must not overlap.
