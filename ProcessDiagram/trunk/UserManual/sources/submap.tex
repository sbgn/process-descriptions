\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Submap}}
\label{sec:submap}

A \glyph{submap} is used to encapsulate processes (including all types of nodes and edges) within one glyph.  The \glyph{submap} hides its content to the users, and display only input terminals (or ports), linked to \glyph{EPNs} (\sect{EPNs}). A \glyph{submap} is not equivalent to an \glyph{omitted process} (see \sect{omitted}).  
In the case of an SBGN description that is made available through a software tool, the content of a \glyph{submap} may be available to the tool.  A user could then ask the tool to expand the \glyph{submap}, for instance by clicking on the icon representing the \glyph{submap}.  The tool might then expand and show the \glyph{submap} within the same map (on the same canvas), or it might open it in a different canvas. In the case of an SBGN description made available in a book or a website, the content of the \glyph{submap} may be available on another page, possibly accessible via an hyperlink on the \glyph{submap}. 

The \glyph{submap} is represented as a square box to remind the viewer that it is fundamentally a process. A \glyph{submap} carries labeled terminals.  When the \glyph{submap} is represented folded, those terminals are linked to external \glyph{EPNs} (\sect{EPNs}).  In the unfolded view, exposing the internal structure of the \glyph{submap}, a set of \glyph{tags} point to the corresponding internal \glyph{EPNs} \sect{EPNs}. A \glyph{tag} is represented by a rectangle fused to an empty arrowhead. The symbol should be linked to one and only one edge (\ie it should reference only one EPN or compartment).

The left part of \fig{submap-folded} represents a \glyph{submap} that transforms glucose into fructose-6-phosphate. The \glyph{submap} carries five terminals, four linked to EPNs and one linked to a \glyph{compartment}.  The latter is particularly important in the case of EPNs present only in a \glyph{compartment} enclosed in a \glyph{submap}, and that are not linked to terminals themselves.  Note that the terminals do not define a ``direction'', such as input or output.  The flux of the reactions is determined by the context. The right part 

The map on the right of \fig{submap-folded} represents an unfolded version of the \glyph{submap}.  Here, anything outside the \glyph{submap} has disappeared, and the internal \glyph{tags} are not linked to the corresponding external \glyph{terminals}. The yellow nodes are also present in the parent map, while the salmon nodes are specific to the submap. Note the tag 5, linking the compartment ``mito'' of the \glyph{submap} to the compartment ``mito'' outside the \glyph{submap}.  The compartment containing Glu6P is implicitly defined as the same as the compartment containing Glu and Fru6P.  There is no ambiguity because if Glu and Fru6P were in different compartments, one of them should have been defined within the \glyph{submap}.
