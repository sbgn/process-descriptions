\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Uncertain process}}\label{sec:uncertain}

Uncertain processes are processes that may not exist. A single \glyph{uncertain process} can represent any number of actual processes. \glyph{Uncertain process} would be used to represent hypothesis, reactions which existence is supported by weak evidence etc. An \glyph{uncertain process} is represented by a \glyph{process} which square box contains a question mark.
