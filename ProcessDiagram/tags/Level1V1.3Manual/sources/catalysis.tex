\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Catalysis}}\label{sec:catalysis}

A catalysis is a particular case of stimulation, where the effector affects
positively the flux of a process represented by the target process. The positive effect on the process is due to the lowering of the activation energy of a reaction. The target extremity of a \glyph{catalysis} carries an empty circle.

The example in \fig{catalysis-MAPK} illustrates the use of \glyph{catalysis} arc to represent the effect of MAPKK on the phophorylation of MAPK.
