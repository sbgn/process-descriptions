\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Process}}
\label{sec:process}

A process is the basic process node in SBGN.  It describes a process that transforms a given set of biochemical entities---macromolecules, simple chemicals or unspecified entities---into another set of biochemical entities.  Such a transformation might imply modification of covalent bonds (conversion), modification of the relative position of constituents (conformational process) or movement from one compartment to another (translocation). A process transforms a set of entity pools (represented by \glyph{EPNs} in \SBGNPDLone) into another set of entity pools. A \glyph{process} is represented by a square box linked to two connectors, small arcs attached to the centers of opposite sides. The consumption (\sect{consumption}) and production (\sect{production}) arcs are linked to the extremities of those connectors. The modulatory arcs (\sect{arcs}) point to the other two sides of the box. A \glyph{process} connected to \glyph{production} arcs on opposite sides is a reversible process.

The example in \fig{trans-react} illustrates the use of a \glyph{process} node to represent a reaction between two reactants that generates three products. The stoichiometry for each entity pool involved is 1, and therefore can be omitted.

The example in \fig{trans-phos} illustrates the use of a \glyph{process} node to represent the phosphorylation of a protein.

The example in \fig{trans-trans} illustrates the use of a \glyph{process} node to represent a translocation. The large round-cornered rectangle represents a compartment border (see \sect{compartment}).

The example in \fig{trans-dim} presents the conversion of two galactoses into a lactose.  Galactoses are represented by only one \glyph{simple chemical}, the cardinality being carried by the \glyph{consumption} arc.
