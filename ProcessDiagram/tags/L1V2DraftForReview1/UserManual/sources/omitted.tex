\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Omitted process}}\label{sec:omitted}

Omitted processes are processes that are known to exist, but are omitted from the map for the sake of clarity or parsimony. A single \glyph{omitted process} can represent any number of actual processes. For instance, one may want to represent a long chain of processes leading from one biochemical compound to another, without detailing all steps, but highlighting the fact that this is not a direct transformation.  The \glyph{omitted process} is different from a \glyph{submap} (\sect{submap}). While a \glyph{submap} references to an explicit content, that is hidden in the main map, the \glyph{omitted process} does not ``hide'' anything within the context of the map, and cannot be ``unfolded''. An \glyph{omitted process} is represented by a \glyph{process} in which the square box contains a two parallel slanted lines oriented northwest-to-southeast and separated by an empty space.
