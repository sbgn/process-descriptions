\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Dissociation}}\label{sec:dissociation}

The dissociation of an \glyph{EPN} into one or more \glyph{EPNs} represents the rupture of a non-covalent binding between the biological entities represented by those \glyph{EPNs}. A \glyph{dissociation} between several entities is represented by two concentric circles. A simple empty disc could be, in some cases, confused with the \glyph{catalysis} (section \sect{catalysis}). Moreover, the existence of two circles reminds the dissociation, by contrast with the filled disc of the \glyph{association} (\sect{association}).
