The development of SBGN was mainly supported by a grant from the Japanese
\emph{New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization} (NEDO,
\url{http://www.nedo.go.jp/}).  The \emph{Okinawa Institute of Science and
  Technology} (OIST, \url{http://www.oist.jp/}), the British
\emph{Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council} (BBSRC,
\url{http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/}) through a Japan Partnering Award, the
European Media Laboratory (EML Research gGmbH,
\url{http://www.eml-r.org/}), and the Beckman Institute at the California
Institute of Technology (\url{http://bnmc.caltech.edu}) provided additional
support for SBGN workshops.  The \emph{Japan Science and Technology Agency}
(JST, \url{http://www.jst.go.jp/}) and the \emph{Genome Network Project} of
the Japanese Ministry of Education, Sports, Culture, Science, and
Technology (MEXT, \url{http://www.mext.go.jp/}) also supported the
development of the gene regulation network aspect of SBGN.
