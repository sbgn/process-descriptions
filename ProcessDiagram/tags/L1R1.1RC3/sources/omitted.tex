\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Omitted process}}\label{sec:omitted}

Omitted processes are processes that are known to exist, but are omitted from the map for the sake of clarity or parsimony. A single \glyph{omitted process} can represent any number of actual processes. The \glyph{omitted process} is different from a \glyph{submap}. While a \glyph{submap} possess an explicit content that is hidden in the main map, the \glyph{omitted process} does not ``hide'' anything within the context of the map, and cannot be ``unfolded''.

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \glyphSboTerm SBO:0000397 - omitted process.
 \glyphOrigin One or several \glyph{consumption} arcs (\sect{consumption}) or one or several \glyph{production} arcs (\sect{production}).
 \glyphTarget One or several \glyph{production} arcs (\sect{production}).

 \glyphNode Omitted processes are represented as a process in which the square box contains a two parallel slanted lines oriented northwest-to-southeast and separated by an empty space.
