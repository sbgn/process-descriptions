\chapter{Process Description Language Grammar}
\label{chp:grammar}

\section{Overview}

In this chapter, we describe how the glyphs of \SBGNPDLone can be combined
to make a valid SBGN \PDm. To do this, we must at the very least
define what glyphs can be connected to each other. This is called
syntax. Next, we must define rules over and above connection rules,
such as whether duplicate symbols are permitted. In addition, we must define what the notation ``means'' --- how does it represent a biological pathway? This is semantics, and it is essential if a reader is to understand a \PDm without external help, and a writer is to create one that reflects his understanding of a biological system.

In this section we start off by describing the concepts of the
\PD{} language. Next a detailed description of the syntax is provided
followed by a description of the syntactic rules of the notation.

\section{Concepts}

The SBGN \PDl{} is more than a collection of symbols. It is a visual language that uses specific abstractions to describe the biological processes that make up a quantitative model, a signalling pathway or a metabolic network. This abstraction is the semantics of SBGN, and to describe it requires more than a definition of the symbols and syntax of the language. We first need to define the abstractions we are using. A \PDm{} in SBGN describes biological processes involving biological entities. An Entity Pool Node (\sect{EPNs}), such as a molecule, is converted into other EPNs via a process. 

It may be convenient to think of a SBGN \PD{} as describing the flow of a fluid. In this analogy, each \glyph{EPN} represents a tank of fluid, which may be emptied via a pipe (the consumption arc, \sect{consumption}) that is connected to a valve (the process node, \sect{PNs}), which in turn is connected to other pipes (the production arcs, \sect{production}) that fill other tanks (\glyph{EPNs}). A valve can be controlled in relation to the amount of fluid in another tank.  This precise nature of the relationship between valve opening and amount of fluid determines the nature of the modulation. Finally, the system needs a source of fluid from one or more external sources (\glyph{source}, section \sect{sourceSink}) and somewhere for it to drain away (the \glyph{sink}). This analogy can equally apply to an electronic circuit, where the valves may be transistors, the Entity Pool Node capacitors, sources the cathode of a battery and an earth as the sink.

%%  In SBGN modulation takes 3 forms:

%% \begin{enumerate}
%% \item The rate of fluid flow through the value is opened is related to the amount of fluid in the modulating tank (modulation arc).
%% \item The rate is directly related to the fluid level in the modulating tank (activation arc).
%% \item The rate is inversely related to the fluid level in the modulating tank (inhibition arc; note that a catalysis arc is identical to this).
%% \end{enumerate}

%% A more subtle form of modulatory control is exhibited by special
%% ```logic'' valves that open based on boolean logic (Logic Gates).
%% These are as follows:

%% \begin{description}
%% \item[AND] The valve has more than one input pipe. If water flows in both pipes then the value opens and lets water flow into its output pipe.
%% \item[OR] This is equivalent to two pipes that flow into one. Fluid from two or more input pipes is directed to the output pipe.
%% \item[NOT] This value must work in conjunction with another valve and
%%   has one input and one output pipe. If fluid flows into the valve
%%   then nothing flows out of it and if there is no flow into it there
%%   is flow out of it.
%% \end{description}

%% The input pipe to a logic valve is in turn connected to a
%% ``pressure-dependent'' value (Existence Arc). This valve only opens at
%% a specified pressure and so it allows us to determine a threshold
%% above which water can flow to the logic valve. This is important as it
%% allows us to convert an analogue value (fluid pressure or in the case
%% of SBGN the concentration of a chemical Entity Pool Node) into a digital true
%% or false value required by Boolean logic.

% Finally, the system needs a source of fluid from one or more external sources (\glyph{source}, section \sect{sourceSink}) and somewhere for it to drain away (the \glyph{sink}).

% This analogy can equally apply to an electronic circuit, where the valves may be transistors, the Entity Pool Node capacitors, sources the cathode of a battery and an earth as the sink.

\section{The conceptual model}

In order to formalize the conceptual representation described above and the semantic rules that we will describe later, we have described the \PDl using UML Domain Object Model. We have used it to define the ``taxonomy'' of the \PD glyphs and their relationship to each other. Finally we describe the attributes of each node glyph that are required to uniquely identify an instance of it in a \PDm. The concept of identity is important in some of the rules described below.

\paragraph*{Notes}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A complex may have a Label or be defined by its subunits. In the case where it has both then all complexes with the same label must also have the same subunit composition.
\item  Generally process nodes are unique, but if all EPNs associated with a process are cloned, then the \glyph{process} must be a duplicate as well.
\end{enumerate}


% The model is separated into two layers. The Visual Layer (\fig{sbgn_visual}) directly maps to the glyphs used to visualise SBGN and reflects the syntax of the notation. The Conceptual Layer describes what is ``meant'' by the visual SBGN representation (\fig{sbgn_conceptual}). It is important in defining concepts such as Entity types and state variables that are implicit in the Visual Layer.
