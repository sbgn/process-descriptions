\section*{Acknowledgements}

The authors are grateful to all the attendees of the SBGN meetings, as well as to the subscribers of the \mailto{sbgn-discuss@sbgn.org} mailing list.  The authors would like to acknowledge especially the help of Frank Bergmann, Sarala Dissanayake, Ralph Gauges, Peter Ghazal, and Lu Li. SM and AS would also like to acknowledge Igor Goryanin whose financial support and encouragement enabled us to commit the necessary time to the development of this specification. A more comprehensive list of people involved in SBGN development is available in the appendix~\ref{sec:acknowledgments}.

The development of SBGN was mainly supported by a grant from the Japanese \emph{New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization} (NEDO, \url{http://www.nedo.go.jp/}).  The \emph{Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology} (OIST, \url{http://www.oist.jp/}), the \emph{AIST Computational Biology Research Center} (AIST CBRC, \url{http://www.cbrc.jp/index.eng.html}) the British \emph{Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council} (BBSRC, \url{http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/}) through a Japan Partnering Award, the European Media Laboratory (EML Research gGmbH, \url{http://www.eml-r.org/}), and the Beckman Institute at the California Institute of Technology (\url{http://bnmc.caltech.edu}) provided additional support for SBGN workshops.  Some help was provided by the \emph{Japan Science and Technology Agency} (JST, \url{http://www.jst.go.jp/}) and the \emph{Genome Network Project} of the Japanese Ministry of Education, Sports, Culture, Science, and Technology (MEXT, \url{http://www.mext.go.jp/}) for the development of the gene regulation network aspect of SBGN, and from the \emph{Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council} (EPSRC, \url{http://www.epsrc.ac.uk}) during the redaction of the specification.
