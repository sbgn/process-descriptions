The UML digrams were created using the UML CASE tool, BOUML 3.4. BOUML
is free and available at http://bouml.free.fr.

The original BOUML file is located in the following sub-directory:

sbgn_bouml/sbgn_bouml.prj

The eps files used in the document were converted from svg files
generated by BOUML. The svg conversion to eps was carried out by
inkscape (www.inkscape.org) or convert (from the ImageMagic
suite). Note that Inkscape conversion is preferred as it generates
smaller files.
