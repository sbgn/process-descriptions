\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Modulation}}\label{sec:modulation}

A modulation affects the flux of a process represented by the target process. Such a modulation can affect the
process \textbf{positively or negatively}, or even both ways depending on the conditions, for instance the concentration of the intervening
participants. A \glyph{modulation} can also be used when one does not know the precise direction of the effect. The target extremity of a \glyph{modulation} carries an empty diamond.

\fig{modul-nico} represents the effect of nicotine on the process converting closed and open states of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. High concentrations of nicotine open the receptor while low concentrations can desensitize it without opening.
