\subsection{Examples of complex EPNs}
\label{sec:CplxEPNs}

In this section, we provide examples of Entity Pool Node representations drawn using the \SBGNPDLone glyphs described above.  The first is a representation of the calcium/calmodulin kinase II, with phosphorylation on the sites threonine 286 and 306, as well as catalytic and autoinhibitory domains.  This is shown in \fig{example-camkii}.  Note the use of \emph{units of information} and \emph{state variables}.

The next EPN example is a representation of the glutamate receptor in the open state, with both phosphorylation and glycosylation.  The entity carries two functional domains, the ligand-binding domain and the ion pore.  \fig{example-glur} gives the diagram.
