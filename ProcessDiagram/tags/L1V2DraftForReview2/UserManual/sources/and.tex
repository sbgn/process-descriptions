\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{And}}\label{sec:and}

The glyph \glyph{and} is used to denote that all the \glyph{EPNs} linked as input are necessary to produce the output. For instance a modulator A \glyph{and} a modulator B, when both present modulate the flux of a process. \glyph{And} is represented by a circle carrying the word ``AND''.
