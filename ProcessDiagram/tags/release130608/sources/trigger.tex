\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Trigger}}\label{sec:trigger}
%\color{blue}

A trigger effect, or absolute stimulation, is a stimulation that is necessary for a process to take place. A process modulated by a trigger can only occur when this trigger is active.

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \item[SBO]\mbox{}\\ SBO:0000171 ! necessary stimulation
 \item[origin]\mbox{}\\ Any EPN (section~\ref{sec:EPNs}) or any logical operator (section~\ref{sec:logic}).
 \item[target]\mbox{}\\ Any transition node (section~\ref{sec:PNs}).
 \item[node]\mbox{}\\ The target extremity of a \glyph{trigger} carries an open arrow (to remind that it is a \glyph{stimulation}) coming after a larger vertical bar.
 \end{glyphDescription}

The example below describes the transcription of a gene X, that is the creation of a messenger RNA X triggered by the gene X. The creation of the protein X is then triggered by the mRNA X. (Note that the same example could be represented using the gene as reactant and product, although it is semantically different).

The example below describe the transport of calcium ions out of the endoplasmic reticulum. Without IP3 receptor, there is not calcium flux, therefore, one cannot use a \glyph{stimulation}. The trigger intead represents this absolute stimulation.
