\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Stimulation}}\label{sec:stimulation}
%\color{blue}

A stimulation affects \textbf{positively} the flux of a process represented by the target transition. This stimulation can be for instance a catalysis or a positive allosteric regulation. Note that \glyph{catalysis} exists independently in SBGN, see section \ref{sec:catalysis}.

\begin{glyphDescription}
 \item[SBO]\mbox{}\\ SBO:0000170 ! stimulation
 \item[origin]\mbox{}\\ Any EPN (section~\ref{sec:EPNs}) or any logical operator (section~\ref{sec:logic}).
 \item[target]\mbox{}\\ Any transition node (section~\ref{sec:PNs}).
 \item[end point]\mbox{}\\ The target extremity of a \glyph{stimulation} carries an empty arrowhead.
 \end{glyphDescription}
