\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Complex}}\label{sec:complex}

A \glyph{complex} node represents a biochemical entity composed of other biochemical entities, whether macromolecules, simple chemicals, multimers, or themselves complexes. 

\begin{glyphDescription}
\glyphSboTerm SBO:0000253 ! non-covalent complex
\glyphContainer A \glyph{complex} possesses its own container box
  surrounding the juxtaposed container boxes of its components. This container box is a rectangle with cut-corners (an octogonal box with sides of two different lengths.). The size of the cut-corners are adjusted so that there is no overlap between the container and the components.
\glyphLabel The identification of a \glyph{named complex}
  is carried by a box containing a string of characters. The
  characters may be distributed on several lines to improve
  readability, although this is not mandatory.  The label box has to
  be attached to the midway between the border of the complex's
  container box and the border of the components' container boxes.
\glyphAux A \glyph{complex} can carry state variables (see section~\ref{sec:stateVariable}). The state of a complex is defined by the set of the all its state variable and all the state variables of all its components.  A \glyph{complex} can also carry one or several \glyph{units
    of information} (see section \ref{sec:unitInfo}). Those units of information can characterise a
  domain, such as a binding site. Particular \glyph{units of information} carry the material type and the conceptual type of the macromolecules. 
  The center of the bounding box of a \glyph{unit of information} is
  located on the midline of the border of the complex. A \glyph{complex} may
  carry a \glyph{clone marker} (see section~\ref{sec:cloneMarker}).
