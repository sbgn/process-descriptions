\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Simple chemical}}
\label{sec:simpleChemical}

A simple chemical in SBGN is defined as the opposite of a macromolecule (\sect{macromolecule}): it is a chemical compound that is \emph{not} formed by the covalent linking of pseudo-identical residues.  Examples of simple chemicals are an atom, a monoatomic ion, a salt, a radical, a solid metal, a crystal, etc.

\begin{glyphDescription}

\glyphSboTerm SBO:0000247 ! simple chemical

\glyphContainer A \glyph{simple chemical} is represented by a circular container, as depicted in \fig{simpleChemical}.

\glyphLabel The identification of the \glyph{simple chemical} is carried by an unbordered box containing a string of characters.  The characters may be distributed on several lines to improve readability, although this is not mandatory.  The label box has to be attached to the center of the circular container.  The label is permitted to spill outside the container.

\glyphAux A \glyph{simple chemical} may be decorated with one or more \glyph{units of information} (\sect{unitInfo}).  A particular \glyph{unit of information} describes the material type.  A \glyph{simple chemical} may also carry a \glyph{clone marker} (\sect{cloneMarker}).
