\subsection{Glyph: \glyph{Multimer}}
\label{sec:multimer}

As its name implies, a multimer is an aggregation of multiple identical or pseudo-identical entities held together by non-covalent bonds.  (Thus, they are distinguished from polymers by the fact that the later involve covalent bonds.)  \emph{Pseudo-identical} here refers to possibility that the entities differ chemically but retain some common global characteristic, such as a structure or function, and so can be considered identical within the context of the SBGN diagram.  An example of this are the homologous subunits in a hetero-oligomeric receptor.

\glyphSboTerm SBO:0000286 ! multimer

\glyphContainer A \glyph{multimer} is represented by two identical containers shifted horizontally and vertically and stacked one on top of the other.  \fig{multimer} illustrates the glyph.

\glyphLabel A \glyph{multimer} has no identity on its own.  However, the first of the monomers carries an identifying label.  The label placed is placed in an unbordered box containing a string of characters.  The characters can be distributed on several lines to improve readability, although this is not mandatory.  The label box must be attached to the center of the top monomer's container.  The label may spill outside of the container.

\glyphAux A \glyph{multimer} can carry state variables that can add information about its state (\sect{stateVariable}).  The state of a multimer is therefore defined as the vector of all its state variables.  A state variable is represented by an ellipsoid container, with the long axis of the ellipsoid placed on the border of the top container of the \glyph{multimer} as illustrated in \fig{multimer}.  Note that a \glyph{state variable} carried by a multimer actually applies to each of the constituent monomers individually.  If instead a state variable is meant apply to the whole multimeric assembly, a \glyph{macromolecule} (\sect{macromolecule}) should be used instead of \glyph{multimer}.  An assembly containing some state variables applicable to the components, and others state variable applicable to the assembly (for instance opening of a channel and phosphorylation of each of its subunits) should be represented by a \glyph{complex} (\sect{complex}).

A \glyph{multimer} can also carry one or several \glyph{units of information} (\sect{unitInfo}).  The information can characterize a domain, such as a binding site.  Particular \glyph{units of information} exist for describing the material type (\sect{material-types-cv}), the conceptual type (\sect{conceptual-types-cv}), and the cardinality (\sect{cardinality-cv}) of the multimer.  Note that a \glyph{unit of information} carried by a multimer actually applies to each of the constituent monomers individually.  If instead a \glyph{unit of information} should be applicable to the whole multimeric assembly, a \glyph{macromolecule} should be used (\sect{macromolecule}). An assembly containing unit of informations applying to the components, and others to the assembly should be represented by a \glyph{complex} (\sect{complex}). The center of the bounding box of a \glyph{unit of information} is located on the midline of the border of the top multimer container.  (See \fig{multimer} for an example.)

A \glyph{multimer} may also carry a \glyph{clone marker} (\sect{cloneMarker}).
